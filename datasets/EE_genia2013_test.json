        "inputsentence": "Resistance to IL-10 inhibition of interferon gamma production and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 in CD4+T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis\nIL-10 has been shown to block the antigen-specific T-cell cytokine response by inhibiting the CD28 signaling pathway. We found that peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were able to produce greater amounts of interferon gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than were normal control CD4+ T cells, although their surface expression of the type 1 IL-10 receptor was increased. The phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 was sustained in both blood and synovial tissue CD4+ T cells of RA, but it was not augmented by the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10. Sera from RA patients induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation in normal CD4+ T cells, which was mostly abolished by neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody. Preincubation of normal CD4+ T cells with IL-6 reduced IL-10-mediated inhibition of interferon gamma production. Blood CD4+ T cells from RA patients contained higher levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 but lower levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA compared with control CD4+ T cells, as determined by real-time PCR. These results indicate that RA CD4+ T cells become resistant to the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10 before migration into synovial tissue, and this impaired IL-10 signaling may be associated with sustained signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 induction.",

        "inputsentence": "IL-10 is a key cytokine in regulating inflammatory responses, mainly by inhibiting the production and function of proinflammatory cytokines. IL-10 binds to the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) complex that is composed of two subunits, the primary ligand-binding component type 1 IL-10R (IL-10R1) and the accessory component type 2 IL-10R [1]. The interaction of IL-10 and IL-10R engages the Janus kinase (JAK) family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Tyk2, which are constitutively associated with IL-10R1 and type 2 IL-10R, respectively [2]. IL-10 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the latent transcriptional factors signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and STAT1 [3]. Upon phosphorylation, STAT1 and STAT3 proteins form homodimers or heterodimers, rapidly translocate into the nucleus, and modulate gene transcription. Intriguingly, STAT3 is indispensable for both IL-10-derived anti-inflammatory and IL-6-derived proinflammatory responses [4]. Studies of cell-type-specific STAT3-deficient mice have shown that STAT3 activation is essential for IL-10-mediated anti-inflammatory reactions in macrophages and neutrophils [5], but is responsible for IL-6-mediated prevention of apoptosis in T cells [6]. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins have been identified as a family of endogenous JAK kinase inhibitors that can act in classic feedback inhibition loops, but their roles as the mediators of crosstalk inhibition by opposing cytokine signaling pathways have been clarified [7]. Recent studies indicate that SOCS3 plays a key role in regulating the divergent action of IL-10 and IL-6, by specifically blocking STAT3 activation induced by IL-6 but not that induced by IL-10 [8,9].\nThe synovial membrane of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by an infiltrate of a variety of inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, together with proliferation of synovial fibroblast-like cells. Numerous cytokines are overproduced in the inflamed joint, and macrophages and synovial fibroblasts are an important source of proinflammatory cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-1, two major macrophage products, are crucial in the process of chronic inflammation and joint destruction, and they give rise to effector components, including other inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, matrix proteases, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species [10]. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine produced substantially by activated fibroblasts, and its proinflammatory actions include simulating the acute-phase response, B-cell maturation into plasma cells, T-cell functions, and hematopoietic precursor cell differentiation [11].\nHowever, anti-inflammatory cytokines and cytokine inhibitors are also present in large quantities in RA joints. IL-10, produced by macrophages and partly by T cells in the synovial tissue (ST), is best known as a negative regulator for macrophage and Th1 cells, but the expression level is insufficient to counterbalance the cascade of proinflammatory events [12]. In addition, the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10 appears to be modulated at the level of signal transduction during chronic inflammation. IL-10 signaling is impaired in macrophages upon chronic exposure to proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 and immune complexes [13,14]. Cell surface expression of IL-10R1 is decreased in synovial fluid dendritic cells due to the presence of TNF-alpha, IL-1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [15].\nCD4+ T cells may be activated by arthritogenic antigens, in conjunction with CD28-mediated costimulatory signaling, in RA. The significance of this autoimmune process has been supported by the linkage of the MHC class II antigens HLA-DRB1*0404 and HLA-DRB1*0401 with disease susceptibility and severity [16,17], and by the high-level expression of MHC class II molecules and both CD28 ligands, CD80 and CD86, in the inflamed ST [18-20]. The continuing emergence of activated CD4+ T cells, even though few in number, may be crucial in sustaining the activation of macrophages and synovial fibroblasts through cell surface signaling by means of cell surface CD69 and CD11, as well as the release of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN)-gamma and IL-17 [21,22]. In addition, CD4+ T cells could stimulate B-cell production of autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor and osteoclast-mediated bone destruction. Their obligatory role in RA synovitis was recently proved by successful treatment of active disease by selective inhibition of T-cell activation with fusion protein of cytotoxic T-cell-associated antigen 4 (CD152)-IgG, which can block the engagement of CD28 on T cells by binding to CD80 and CD86 with high avidity [23].\nIL-10 efficiently blocks the antigen-specific T-cell cytokine response by inhibiting the CD28 signaling pathway [24], as well as indirectly by downregulating the function of antigen-presenting cells. To elucidate the resistance of CD4+ T cells to this direct inhibition in RA, we investigated the production of IFN-gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of IL-10, the induction of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation by IL-10, and the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA in peripheral blood (PB) CD4+ T cells from RA patients.",

To evaluate the responsiveness of RA CD4+ T cells to IL-10, purified PB CD4+ T cells from three patients with active RA and from three healthy controls were stimulated by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody and anti-CD28 antibody with or without diluted concentrations of IL-10 for 36 hours, and IFN-gamma production was measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1, IFN-gamma production by activated normal CD4+ T cells was mostly inhibited at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml IL-10. However, RA CD4+ T cells were able to produce significant amounts of IFN-gamma in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10, and the maximal but not complete inhibition by IL-10 was obtained at 10-100 ng/ml.\nWe thus compared the levels of IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients with active disease (multiple inflammatory joints, CRP level >= 10 mg/l) and inactive disease (in remission, CRP level < 10 mg/l) [26] and in healthy controls. There were no statistically significant differences in IFN-gamma production without IL-10 among these three groups (Fig. 2a), but the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on IFN-gamma production was significantly limited in the active RA group as compared with the inactive RA group and healthy controls (percentage decrease: active RA, 2.9 +/- 14.4%; inactive RA, 45.6 +/- 14.4%; controls, 65.8 +/- 7.9%) (Fig. 2b). As a consequence, CD4+ T cells from active RA patients produced higher levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than did normal CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2a).\nIn addition, we compared IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of IL-10 in active RA patients and in healthy controls. Similarly, IL-2 production was not affected by 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients (percentage decrease, -2.1 +/- 13.8%), while it was significantly reduced in healthy controls (61.1 +/- 13.7%; P < 0.05).

Since IL-6 is also abundant in sera of active RA patients, frequently detected at > 1 ng/ml [27], we examined whether persistent exposure of CD4+ T cells to high concentrations of IL-6 in the blood circulation was responsible for their sustained STAT3 activation and resistance to IL-10 inhibition in active RA. Both STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation was activated by IL-6 in normal CD4+ T cells (data not shown), in agreement with previous observations [4]. Normal CD4+ T cells were thus incubated for 20 min with culture medium containing 30% serum from active RA patients and neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody or control antibody, and STAT phosphorylation was examined by western blot analysis. RA serum was able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 but not STAT1, and this STAT3 activation was mostly abolished by neutralization of IL-6 activity (Fig. 5a). These results indicate that IL-6 is the dominant STAT3-activating factor contained in sera of active RA patients. The lack of STAT1 activation by RA serum suggests that much higher concentrations of IL-6 may be required for STAT1 activation as compared with STAT3 activation, or that inhibitors of STAT1 signaling may be present in RA serum.\nWe next examined whether IL-6 could suppress the effect of IL-10 to inhibit IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells. After preincubation with or without 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 36 hours, normal CD4+ T cells were stimulated by CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 for 36 hours, and the IFN-gamma production was measured by ELISA. IL-6 pretreatment of normal cells reduced IL-10-mediated inhibition of IFN-gamma production (Fig. 5b), indicating that high concentrations of IL-6 could modulate T-cell responsiveness to IL-10. Taken together, these findings suggest that persistent exposure to serum IL-6 may have a role in both the induction of STAT3 activation and the resistance to the inhibitory effect of IL-10 in RA CD4+ T cells.",

SOCS3 has recently been shown to specifically inhibit STAT3 activation induced by IL-6 but not by IL-10, thereby regulating the divergent action of IL-6 and IL-10 [8,9].

To determine whether SOCSs were involved in the defective IL-10-induced STAT3 activation of RA CD4+ T cells, the levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expression in PB CD4+ T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls were compared by semiquantitative real-time PCR. The RA CD4+ T cells contained higher levels of SOCS1 but lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts than did control CD4+ T cells (Fig. 6a). Constitutive expression of SOCS1 mRNA in RA CD4+ T cells was comparable with the expression in normal CD4+ T cells stimulated by 10 ng/ml IL-6 (Fig. 6b), supporting its functional significance.

Activated CD4+ T cells stimulate macrophages, synovial fibroblasts, B cells, and osteoclasts through the expression of cell surface molecules and Th1 cytokines, thereby contributing to both the chronic inflammation and the joint destruction. CD4+ T cells require two signals to be activated; antigen receptor occupancy and CD28-mediated costimulation. In the ST lesion, the CD28 ligands, both CD80 and CD86, together with MHC class II antigens, are substantially expressed by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells [18-20]. The significance of CD28 engagement in the T-cell-mediated disease process has recently been proven by the clinical efficacy of its blocker cytotoxic T-cell-associated antigen 4 (CD152)-IgG in RA patients [23].\nIL-10 plays a predominant role in limiting immune and inflammatory responses by regulating the function of both macrophages and Th1 cells [1]. IL-10 inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD28 molecule and the subsequent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding in T cells, and thereby directly acts on T cells [24]. In the present study, we found that PB CD4+ T cells from patients with active RA, in the presence of IL-10, are able to produce higher levels of IFN-gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation than normal CD4+ T cells. Despite high-level IL-10R1 expression and constitutive STAT3 activation, IL-10-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is suppressed in RA CD4+ T cells, in contrast to normal CD4+ T cells, where STAT3 phosphorylation is dose-dependently inducible by IL-10. Serum IL-6 from RA patients induces STAT3 but not STAT1 phosphorylation in normal CD4+ T cells, and exogenous IL-6 induces the resistance to IL-10 inhibition of IFN-gamma production. RA CD4+ T cells contain higher levels of SOCS1 but contain lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts in comparison with normal CD4+ T cells. These findings indicate that CD4+ T cells become resistant to the inhibitory effect of IL-10 before migration into the inflamed ST, and suggest that this resistance may be attributable to impaired IL-10-dependent STAT3 activation, in association with sustained STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS1 induction.\nIL-10-mediated inhibition of CD4+ T-cell cytokine production is principally dependent on its inhibition of macrophage antigen-presenting cell function [1]. However, this indirect inhibitory effect is thought to be restricted at the site of T-cell activation in RA, because macrophages in the ST express high levels of cytokines, CD80 and CD86 molecules, and MHC class II antigens [10,18-20]. More recently, IL-10 has been shown to induce the antigen-specific T-cell unresponsiveness by inhibiting CD28 tyrosine phosphorylation [33]. This direct effect also may be limited in active RA patients, because their PB CD4+ T cells showed a defective IL-10 inhibition of CD28-costimulated production of both IFN-gamma and IL-2.\nNumerous cytokines, both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory, have been detected in the ST of RA, and the balance between these opposing cytokine activities regulates disease severity [10]. Endogenous IL-10, produced mainly by macrophages and T cells, inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production by ST cells [12]. However, this regulatory activity seems to be restricted during chronic inflammation. The activation of both the extracellular stimulus-regulated kinase and p38 kinase pathways, induced by TNF-alpha and IL-1, inhibits the Jak1-STAT3 signaling pathway shared by IL-10 and IL-6 in adhered macrophages [13]. More importantly, IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation is mostly undetectable in RA synovial macrophages. This impaired IL-10 signaling is probably induced by chronic exposure to immune complexes in vivo, because both cell surface IL-10R1 expression and IL-10-induced Jak1 activation are suppressed in IFN-gamma-primed macrophages by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway following ligation of the IgG Fc gamma receptor [14]. Furthermore, dendritic cells from RA synovial fluids are resistant to the immunoregulatory effect of IL-10 due to decreased transport of intracellular IL-10R1 in the presence of proinflammatory cytokine stimuli such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [15]. We have demonstrated that the resistance of RA CD4+ T cells to IL-10 may be associated with defective IL-10-dependent STAT3 activation, but not with IL-10R1 expression. Inhibitory effects of IL-10 on these inflammatory cell types are therefore differentially modulated at the signal transduction level under the inflammatory environment in RA.\nIn association with impaired IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation, STAT3 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated persistently (up to 6 hours) in freshly isolated PB and ST CD4+ T cells from RA patients. STAT3 is activated by a variety of cytokines, notably the IL-6 family of cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M) and growth factors, in addition to IL-10 [4]. Of these cytokines, IL-6 plays a predominant role in eliciting a systemic reaction such as the acute phase response in active RA, due mainly to its abundance in the blood circulation [27]. Consistent with this notion, IL-6 was the major STAT3-activating factor contained in the serum of active RA patients, and the responsiveness to IL-10 was suppressed in normal CD4+ T cells after 36 hours of incubation with IL-6. These results suggest that both the sustained STAT3 activation and the resistance to IL-10 inhibition found in RA CD4+ T cells may be induced after chronic exposure in vivo to high concentrations of serum IL-6. However, it is also possible that STAT3 activity could be constitutively induced in CD4+ T cells by their own IL-10 secretion, leading to the loss of sensitivity to exogenous IL-10, because RA CD4+ T cells in the ST are capable of producing significant levels of IL-10 [34].\nCD4+ T cells isolated from the ST of RA also showed a defect in the IL-10-induced STAT3 signaling pathway. It is most probable that the resistance of CD4+ T cells to IL-10 can be even augmented after migration into the inflamed ST, because IL-6 is highly concentrated compared with the blood level [27]. In addition, the involvement of other essential proinflammatory cytokines in this process was suggested by our preliminary experiments demonstrating that IL-10-mediated IFN-gamma inhibition in CD4+ T cells was reduced by pretreatment with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, although less effectively than by IL-6 (data not shown). Furthermore, IFN-gamma and IL-10 produced by CD4+ T cells themselves could be responsible for impaired IL-10 signaling in the ST, because T-cell infiltrates produce both cytokines [34,35]. In an autocrine fashion, IL-10 may persistently stimulate STAT3 activation and IFN-gamma can induce SOCS1 protein as a crosstalk inhibitor of IL-10 signaling [32]. The T-cell-inhibitory effect of IL-10 may therefore be modulated complicatedly upon exposure to an inflammatory environment in RA joints, where many cytokines are present substantially [10].\nSTAT3 activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. Active STAT3 is constitutively expressed in synovial fluid mononuclear cells from RA patients [36]. IL-6 is the major STAT3-activating factor present in synovial fluid, which has a crucial role in the activation of monocyte functions such as gene expression of the Fc gamma receptor type I and type III and of HLA-DR [31]. More recently, high levels of activated STAT3, thought to be induced mainly by IL-6, have been detected in the ST, and STAT3 activation has been shown to be involved in synovial fibroblast proliferation and IL-6 production [37]. In this regard, STAT3 is critical in the survival and expansion of growth factor-dependent synovial fibroblasts [38]. Furthermore, the significance of persistent STAT3 signaling in Th1-cell-dominated autoimmune arthritis has been suggested by studies of the gp130F759/F759 mice, in which the Src homology phosphatase-2 binding site of gp130 (the transmembrane glycoprotein beta subunit of the IL-6 family cytokine receptor), tyrosine 759, was mutated to phenylalanine [39]. In the gp130F759/F759 mice, T cells, particularly the CD4+ T-cell subset, are chronically activated and resistant to activation-induced cell death through gp130-mediated STAT3 activation.\nThe longevity of cytokine signals transduced by the JAK-STAT pathway is regulated by the SOCS family proteins [7]. We found that CD4+ T cells from patients with active RA expressed higher levels of SOCS1, but lower levels of SOCS3, compared with normal CD4+ T cells. SOCS1 prevents activation of JAK by directly binding to JAK, and SOCS3 inhibits the action of JAK by binding to the Src homology phosphatase-2-binding domain of receptors such as gp130 [40]. SOCS1 and SOCS3 are induced by various cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-10, as mediators of negative feedback and crosstalk inhibition [7]. Recent studies with mice lacking SOCS3 or SOCS1 revealed that SOCS3 is a negative regulator of IL-6 signaling but not of IL-10 signaling. Studies of conditional SOCS3-deficient mice have shown that SOCS3 deficiency, but not SOCS1 deficiency, results in sustained activation of STAT3 in response to IL-6 [8,41]. The analysis of SOCS3-deficient macrophages has indicated that SOCS3 is a crucial inhibitor of the IL-6-induced transcriptional response [42]. However, SOCS3 is dispensable for both the negative feedback inhibition and the immunoregulatory action of IL-10 in macrophages [41]. On the contrary, SOCS1 was found to directly inhibit IL-10-mediated signaling [43]. Increased SOCS1 expression in RA CD4+ T cells may therefore be associated with both the impaired responsiveness to IL-10 and to IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation, and defective SOCS3 expression may be responsible for persistent STAT3 activation in response to serum IL-6.\nThere is a possibility that SOCS1 induction may be associated with the ability of CD4+ T cells to produce IFN-gamma, because CD4+ T cells from active RA could produce high levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of IL-10, and because IFN-gamma has been known as a potent inducer of SOCS1 [32]. It is of interest in this regard to indicate that polarized Th1 and Th2 cells express high levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA, respectively [44]. IL-12-induced STAT4 activation is inhibited by SOCS3 induction in Th2 cells, whereas IL-4-induced STAT6 signaling is diminished by SOCS1 induction in Th1 cells. SOCS1 and SOCS3 may thus have important roles as Th1-specific and Th2-specific, mutually exclusive, cross-talk repressors of the IL-4-STAT6 and the IL-12-STAT4 signaling pathways, respectively. Consistent with this notion, PB T cells from patients with allergic diseases significantly express high levels of SOCS3 transcripts, and the SOCS3 expression correlates well with serum IgE levels and disease pathology [45]. Higher SOCS1 expression with lower SOCS3 expression in PB CD4+ T cells from RA patients, compared with healthy controls, is therefore probably consistent with their systemic bias towards a Th1 phenotype, as has previously been demonstrated [46-49].",

The defective STAT3 signaling is possibly associated with SOCS1 predominance over SOCS3. These abnormalities in active RA are thought to be induced mainly after chronic exposure to high concentrations of IL-6. The limited efficacy of IL-10 treatment of RA patients [50] may be explained in part by the unresponsiveness to IL-10 of inflammatory cells, including T cells. On the contrary, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-IL-6 receptor antibody has been reported in RA patients [51], and one of the effects of this therapy may be to normalize T cells through the inhibition of IL-6-dependent STAT3 activation. More specific therapy targeting STAT3 activation will be awaited; for example, the induction of the SOCS3 gene, the efficacy of which has been demonstrated in animal models [37].",

        "inputsentence": "Increased interleukin-17 production via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and nuclear factor ?B-dependent pathway in patients with rheumatoid arthritis\nInflammatory mediators have been recognized as being important in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Interleukin (IL)-17 is an important regulator of immune and inflammatory responses, including the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and osteoclastic bone resorption. Evidence for the expression and proinflammatory activity of IL-17 has been demonstrated in RA synovium and in animal models of RA. Although some cytokines (IL-15 and IL-23) have been reported to regulate IL-17 production, the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate IL-17 production remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the regulation of IL-17 production in RA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with RA (n = 24) were separated, then stimulated with various agents including anti-CD3, anti-CD28, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. IL-17 levels were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The production of IL-17 was significantly increased in cells treated with anti-CD3 antibody with or without anti-CD28 and PHA (P < 0.05). Among tested cytokines and chemokines, IL-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and IL-6 upregulated IL-17 production (P < 0.05), whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-18 or transforming growth factor-beta did not. IL-17 was also detected in the PBMC of patients with osteoarthritis, but their expression levels were much lower than those of RA PBMC. Anti-CD3 antibody activated the PI3K/Akt pathway; activation of this pathway resulted in a pronounced augmentation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA-binding activity. IL-17 production by activated RA PBMC is completely or partly blocked in the presence of the NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin and LY294002, respectively. However, inhibition of activator protein-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 did not affect IL-17 production. These results suggest that signal transduction pathways dependent on PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB are involved in the overproduction of the key inflammatory cytokine IL-17 in RA.",

        "inputsentence": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by infiltrations of macrophages and T cells into the joint, and synovial hyperplasia. Proinflammatory cytokines released from these cells are known to be important in the destruction of joints in RA [1]. The favorable clinical benefits obtained with inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1 suggest that the blockade of key inflammatory cytokines has been the important issue in the development of new therapeutic applications [2].\nA little over a decade ago, the primacy of T cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease such as RA was undisputed because they are the largest cell population infiltrating the synovium. However, a series of studies demonstrated paucity of T cell-derived cytokines such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma in the joints of RA, whereas macrophage and fibroblast cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-15, IL-18 and TNF-alpha were abundant in rheumatoid synovium. This paradox has questioned the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of RA [3]. Because we have already demonstrated the enhanced proliferation of antigen specific T cells, especially to type II collagen, and the skewing of T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines in RA [4], the role of T cells needs to be elucidated in different aspects.\nIL-17 is one of the inflammatory cytokines secreted mainly by activated T cells, which can induce IL-6 and IL-8 by fibroblasts [5]. This cytokine is of interest for two major reasons: first, similarly to TNF-alpha and IL-1, IL-17 has proinflammatory properties; second, it is produced by T cells [6]. Recent observations demonstrated that IL-17 can also activate osteoclastic bone resorption by the induction of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB [NF-kappaB] ligand), which is involved in bony erosion in RA [7]. It also stimulates the production of IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor by synoviocytes, and of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide by chondrocytes, and has the ability to differentiate and activate the dendritic cells [8-10]. Levels of IL-17 in synovial fluids were significantly higher in patients with RA than in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and it was produced by CD4+ T cells in the synovium [11,12].\nIL-15, secreted from activated macrophages, has been reported to be an important trigger of IL-17 production in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by cyclosporine and steroid sensitive pathways [13]. Recently, Happel and colleagues also showed that IL-23 could be an efficient trigger of IL-17 production from both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [14].\nAlthough the contribution of IL-17 in joint inflammation in RA has been documented in earlier studies [12,15,16], the intracellular signal transduction pathway for IL-17 production remains uncertain. In the present study we used various stimuli to investigate IL-17 production in PBMC of patients with RA and its signaling transduction pathway.\nWe found that the intracellular signaling pathway involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and NF-kappaB might be involved in the overproduction of the key inflammatory cytokine IL-17 in RA. These results might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RA and future directions for new therapeutic strategies in RA.",

Nuclear extracts (2 mug of protein) were incubated with radiolabeled DNA probes (10 ng; 100,000 c.p.m.) for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mul of binding buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.2% Nonidet P40 and 50 ng/mul poly(dI-dC). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 x Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) at 100 V. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film at -70degreesC with intensifying screens.

        "inputsentence": "IL-17 was first described as a T cell product with proinflammatory properties [5,22]. RA is characterized by hyperplasia of synovial lining cells and an intense infiltration by mononuclear cells [23]. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha are abundant in rheumatoid synovium, whereas the T cell-derived cytokines, especially IL-4 and interferon-gamma, have often proved difficult to detect in RA synovium [24]. Although T cells may have a role in the augmentation of rheumatoid synovial inflammation, the lack of T cell-derived cytokines has limited its importance. In this respect, IL-17 is appealing because it has been described as a T cell-derived cytokine with proinflammatory properties.\nIn our studies, we tried to evaluate how IL-17 production is regulated in RA PBMC, and which signaling pathway it used. Levels of IL-17 were found to be higher in RA synovial fluid than in OA synovial fluid [15]. However, there are few data available on the agents that stimulate IL-17 production in RA, although the highest level of IL-17 production can be achieved by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation in healthy individuals [25]. In our experiments, PHA as mitogens, as well as anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for signaling through the T cell receptor, increased IL-17 production from RA PBMC in a dose-dependent manner. We found, by a cell proliferation assay (data not shown), that this upregulation of IL-17 might be due to increased cellular activity rather than to cellular proliferation.\nIL-17 is produced mainly by activated CD4+ T cells, especially for Th1/Th0 cells, not the Th2 phenotype [26]. However, it can also be produced by CD8+ T cells via an IL-23 triggering mechanism in Gram-negative pulmonary infection [14]. In addition, IL-17 production was significantly augmented by T cells recognizing type II collagen in a collagen-induced arthritis model [27]. A complex interaction between cells in inflamed RA joints might produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which also activate other cells in the joints. For example, IL-17 stimulates rheumatoid synoviocytes to secrete several cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 as well as prostaglandin E2 in vitro [12,28,29]. There are as yet few data available on the agents that stimulate IL-17 production in RA, although some cytokines (IL-15 and IL-23) have been known to regulate IL-17 production [13,14]. We therefore investigated the in vitro production of IL-17 in RA PBMC responding to a variety of cytokines/chemokines and mitogens as well as T cell receptor (TCR) ligation using anti-CD3/anti-CD28. Our studies demonstrated that IL-15 and MCP-1 as well as TCR ligation significantly increased the production of IL-17 in RA PBMC. Adding IL-15 or MCP-1 to TCR ligation augmented IL-17 production more markedly. In contrast, IL-1 and TNF-alpha, which are known to have proinflammatory properties and to be increased in RA joints, did not affect IL-17 production. Our data were consistent with a recent report that IL-15 triggered in vitro IL-17 production in PBMC, but TNF-alpha did not do so [13]. Although there were no data that MCP-1 directly induces T cell activation, it might exert effects indirectly on T cells through the activation of monocytes/macrophages in PBMC cultures. As reported for normal individuals [25], T cell activation through anti-CD3/anti-CD28 also increases IL-17 induction in RA PBMC.\nAlthough the signaling pathway for the induction of cytokines/chemokines by IL-17 has been documented widely [8,30,31], no data have been available on how IL-17 production can be regulated by certain signaling pathways. By using signal transduction inhibitors, we therefore examined which signaling pathway was mainly involved in the induction of IL-17 in RA PBMC.\nWe identified that anti-CD3-induced IL-17 production in RA PBMC was significantly hampered by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC to comparable levels of basal production without stimulation. We also found that anti-CD3-induced IL-17 production was downregulated by the addition of SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor. It is interesting that a series of evidence supports crosstalk between NF-kappaB and p38. In myocytes, IkappaB kinase-beta is activated by p38 [32], and the activated p38 can stimulate NF-kappaB by a mechanism involving histone acetylase p300/CREB-binding protein [33]. Our results revealed that p38 MAPK activation was not affected by LY294002, whereas NF-kappaB binding activity was decreased by LY294002, which provided the evidence for a p38 MAPK pathway independent of PI3K activation. The direct relationship between p38 and NF-kappaB for IL-17 production needs to be studied in future experiments.\nThe search for a downstream pathway of PI3K seemed to have a maximal response of Akt activation at 1 hour and a gradual loss of activity at 2 hours. The fact that Akt is phosphorylated upon anti-CD3 stimulation suggests the possible involvement of PI3K in the induction of IL-17 in RA. In view of the fact that NF-kappaB was also activated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28, IL-15 or mitogens in our experiments, it is most likely that the NF-kappaB pathway is also actively involved in the induction of IL-17 in RA PBMC. In contrast, the AP-1 signal transduction pathway, another important signaling pathway for cytokines/chemokines, was not activated in our experiments (data not shown). Although PI3K and its downstream kinase Akt in association with NF-kappaB have been reported to deliver activating signals in many cell types, the data on the signal inducing IL-17 are lacking. Our data clearly demonstrated that PI3K/Akt and resultant NF-kappaB activation could be an important arbitrator of the upregulation of IL-17 in RA, on the basis of our experiments showing simultaneous blocking of NF-kappaB binding activity in the IL-17 promoter by PDTC and LY294002. Considering its proinflammatory activities and successful induction of anti-IL-17 for ameliorating arthritis in animal models [2,6,34-36], understanding the IL-17 signaling pathway is an important element of developing new targeted therapies in RA.",

Previous studies have suggested that Sox6 plays a role in the development of the central nervous system, cartilage, and muscle. In the Sox6-deficient mouse, p100H, epsilony globin is persistently expressed, and increased numbers of nucleated red cells are present in the fetal circulation. Transfection assays in GM979 (erythroleukemic) cells define a 36-base pair region of the epsilony proximal promoter that is critical for Sox6 mediated repression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that Sox6 acts as a repressor by directly binding to the epsilony promoter. The normal expression of Sox6 in wild-type fetal liver and the ectopic expression of epsilony in p100H homozygous fetal liver demonstrate that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis. The present study shows that Sox6 is required for silencing of epsilony globin in definitive erythropoiesis and suggests a role for Sox6 in erythroid cell maturation.

        "inputsentence": "Sry type HMG box (Sox6) is a member of the Sox transcription factor family characterized by the conserved high mobility group (HMG) domain, consisting of 79 amino acids involved in DNA recognition and binding [1]. Sox transcription factors bind to the minor groove of DNA and cause a 70degrees-85degrees bend of the DNA that leads to local conformational changes [2,3], while most other transcription factors target the major groove of DNA [4]. Therefore, Sox proteins may perform part of their function as architectural proteins by organizing local chromatin structure and assembling other DNA-bound transcription factors into biologically active, sterically defined multiprotein complexes. Sox6 has been reported to be able to act as either an activator or a repressor, depending on its interactors and its target promoter context [5,6]. Intriguingly, Sox6 has also been shown to act as a general splicing factor that participates in pre-mRNA splicing [7]. Depletion of Sox6 in HeLa cell extracts blocked splicing of multiple substrates, and expression of the HMG domain of either Sox6, Sox9, or Sry in the extracts restored splicing, indicating functional overlap of these proteins [7]. Regardless of how Sox6 functions in regulating gene expression, previous studies have demonstrated that Sox6 is an important regulatory molecule that plays a role in the development of the central nervous system [8-11], cartilage [6,12,13], and muscle [14,15]. A Sox6-null mutant mouse (p100H) has previously been identified in our laboratory [14]. Mice homozygous for p100H show delayed growth, develop myopathy and arterioventricular heart block, and die within 2 wk after birth [14]. The p100H mutant allele is associated with a Chromosome 7 inversion that disrupts both the p gene and the Sox6 gene (and no other gene within 50,000 nucleotides of the chromosomal breakpoints) [14]. Because the p gene functions solely in pigmentation [16], the Sox6 transcription factor is implicated in all other phenotypes.\nAmong the HMG box proteins distantly related to Sry (the first member identified of the Sox transcription factor family) that similarly bind to the minor groove and bend DNA, but without sequence specificity, are the ubiquitously expressed HMG1 and HMG2 proteins [17]. Modulation of DNA structure by these and other HMG proteins can mediate long-range enhancer function on both DNA and chromatin-assembled genes by bringing together distant regions of DNA and associated factors. Specifically, HMG proteins have been shown to modulate beta-globin genes [18-21].\nThe mouse beta-globin genes {epsilony, betah1, beta-major, and beta-minor} are clustered on Chromosome 7 and they are highly homologous to their human counterparts in organizational structure and function [22]. High-level expression of these genes requires a regulatory element, the locus control region that is characterized by a set of nuclease hypersensitive sites spread over 25 kb located 5' of the epsilony gene [23]. The beta-globin genes are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific fashion. In mice, erythropoiesis originates in the embryonic yolk sac where primitive erythroid cells express epsilony and betah-1 globins [22]. At 11.5 d post coitus (dpc), erythropoiesis shifts to the fetal liver where definitive erythroid cells express adult beta globins (beta major and minor) [22]. The epsilony gene is silenced in definitive erythroid cells. The mechanism of silencing of its human counterpart, epsilon globin, has been studied extensively. In definitive erythropoiesis, epsilon is activated and silenced autonomously [24,25], although in primitive erythropoiesis epsilon also appears to be regulated competitively [26]. The gamma-globin to adult beta-globin switch is controlled by promoter competition for the LCR [24,25].\nAll the elements responsible for silencing the epsilon globin gene are within the epsilon gene or in adjacent sequences [27], suggesting that silencing is primarily gene autonomous. Using promoter deletion analyses in transgenic mouse models and cell transfection assays, multiple DNA elements important to the silencing process have been previously identified in both the proximal and the distal epsilon gene promoter [27]. Their corresponding transcription factors, such as GATA-1, YY-1, COUP-TF, and DRED have been identified and shown to directly bind to these DNA elements (as part of protein complexes) to regulate epsilon silencing [27]. Thus, it appears that the silencing of the epsilon gene involves a complicated network of multiple cis elements and transacting proteins.\nIn addition to playing an important role in the development of the central nervous system [8-11], cartilage [6,12,13], and muscle [14,15], it was shown that Sox6 is upregulated in long-term hematopoiesis stem cells (LT-HSC) compared with multipotent progenitors of adult mouse bone marrow lineage [28]. In this study, we describe that Sox6 also exerts pleiotropic effects on erythropoiesis. These effects include delayed maturation of erythrocytes (that normally enucleate prior to entering the bloodstream [27]) and higher expression of embryonic globin genes. The most extreme effect is the persistence of high expression of the embryonic epsilony globin gene. Here we describe and characterize the effects of Sox6 on the epsilony globin gene. We show that Sox6 binds to the proximal promoter of epsilony globin and represses its transcription. In wild-type (WT) mice, Sox6 is not expressed in yolk sac blood islands, but is expressed in fetal liver, the opposite expression pattern of epsilony globin. In the absence of Sox6, epsilony globin is ectopically expressed in the fetal liver, demonstrating that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis.",

This initial observation was confirmed in an independent knock-out allele of Sox6 [13] using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (unpublished data). Real-time PCR was used to quantitate the expression levels of other globin genes in p100H mutant and WT mouse livers at two developmental stages, 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc. As shown in Figure 1, the epsilony gene is expressed at high levels at both time points in mutant mice, in contrast to the decline in expression observed in WT mice. No difference was seen between WT and heterozygous mice (unpublished data). Interestingly, the expression levels of the other two embryonic globin genes (zeta and betah1) are also higher in p100H homozygous mice, compared with WT mice, but to a much lesser extent than seen for epsilony globin at 18.5 dpc (Figure 1). Moreover, the expression level of adult beta globin is also somewhat higher in p100H homozygous mice than in WT mice at 18.5 dpc (Figure 1). Perinatal lethality of mutant mice (presumably from the heart defect [14]) precludes us from evaluating postnatal globin expression. The graphs in Figure 1 illustrate real time PCR results that were performed in triplicate (standard deviation of the data is shown by error bars). Because all of the assays were performed at the same time with the same internal control, the levels shown are relative levels and are thus comparable across all samples and are in agreement with previously published results for WT fetal mice [29]. We note that the level of epsilony expression in the livers of 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc homozygous mutant mice is statistically equivalent to the level of betamaj/min expression in the livers of 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc homozygous WT mice.",

        "inputsentence": "Transfection Studies Using GM979 Cells Indicate That Sox6 Directly Represses the epsilony Gene Promoter at the Transcriptional Level\nReal-time PCR assays (Figure 1) measure steady-state levels of epsilony mRNA, not transcriptional activity of the epsilony promoter. To investigate whether Sox6 directly acts on the epsilony gene promoter at the transcriptional level, we used an in vitro transient transfection assay and GM979 cells, a murine erythroleukemic cell line that expresses both epsilony and adult beta globins [30]. We generated an epsilony promoter reporter construct (E-Luc) by fusing a micro-LCR (muLCR) element (2.5 kb) [31] to the epsilony proximal promoter (2.2 kb), followed by the luciferase reporter gene, as shown in Figure 2A (detailed in Materials and Methods). Overexpression of Sox6 in GM979 cells by transient transfection leads to a dosage-dependent repression of E-Luc reporter activity (Figure 2B). In contrast, overexpression of a truncated Sox6 protein that lacks its HMG domain [32] (similar to the p100H mouse allele) fails to repress E-Luc activity (Figure 2B). These data indicate that Sox6 acts to repress the epsilony promoter at the transcriptional level.\nSox6 has been shown to act as a repressor and to interact with a widely expressed co-repressor, CtBP2, on the fgf-3 promoter [5]. CtBP2 is expressed in GM979 cells (unpublished data). To investigate whether the interaction with CtBP2 is required for Sox6 repression of the epsilony promoter, we introduced a point mutation (L386H) in the Sox6 protein that has been previously reported to be sufficient to abolish Sox6-CtBP2 interaction [5]. This amino acid change is not in the HMG DNA binding domain. However, this mutant version of Sox6 retains the ability to repress the epsilony promoter in the transfection assay (Figure 2B), indicating that Sox6 represses the epsilony promoter in a CtBP2-independent manner. Deletion analysis of the epsilony promoter, as shown in Figure 2C, defined a region (-63 to -37) within the epsilony proximal promoter that is critical for Sox6 repression. Analysis of this short region reveals two Sox/Sox6 consensus binding sites [5] (Figure 3A).",

        "inputsentence": "EMSA and ChIP Assays Show that Sox6 Directly Binds to the epsilony Promoter\nSox6 might repress the epsilony promoter, either through direct physical contact with the promoter or by regulating intermediates affecting the epsilony promoter. To investigate whether Sox6 is directly associated with the epsilony promoter, we first performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using a c-Myc-tagged Sox6 in a reticulocyte lysate-based transcription/translation in vitro system. The probes used are listed in Figure 3A. The 36-base pair (bp) WT probe corresponds to the critical region of the epsilony promoter defined in our promoter deletion analyses. This probe contains two consensus Sox/Sox6 binding sites. Also included in our EMSA are three mutated probes that are, either truncated (M1), or mutated (M2 and M3) in Sox/Sox6 binding sites (Figure 3A). Sox6 is able to physically associate with the 36-bp region (Figure 3B) within the epsilony promoter defined by the deletion analysis experiments (Figure 2C). The 36-bp probe was shifted by the tagged Sox6 protein. Moreover, both c-Myc and Sox6 antibodies supershift the band, indicating that the binding is Sox6-specific. To rule out the possibility that the c-Myc tag itself binds to the probe, an HA-tagged Sox6 was used in another EMSA that confirmed these results (Figure 3C).\nNext, nuclear extracts from MEL cells were used in EMSA employing the same 36-bp probe. MEL cells, a murine erythroleukemic cell line, express adult beta globins, but not epsilony [33]. Sox6 directly binds to this DNA sequence in MEL cells (Figure 3D). The intact consensus Sox/Sox6 binding sites of the DNA probe are required for the binding, as shown in the competition assay (Figure 3E). Ablation of putative Sox/Sox6 binding sites (M1 and M3) abolish their ability to compete in EMSA (Figure 3E). The M2 mutant probe may compete partially with WT binding.\nTo investigate the functional significance of the intact Sox/Sox6 binding sites, the epsilony promoter reporter constructs with mutagenized Sox/Sox6 binding sites were co-transfected with the Sox6 overexpression vector into GM979 cells. Consistent with the EMSA results, the mutant epsilony promoter reporter constructs (with either one or both Sox/Sox6 binding sites mutagenized) do not result in significant promoter repression in transfection studies (Figure 3F). Thus, both sites are required for maximal repression of epsilony by Sox6, but not to the same degree.\nWe also tested whether Sox6 binds to the epsilony promoter in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (Figure 4). The Sox6-containing complex was immunoprecipitated from MEL cells or from liver cells of 15.5 dpc WT mice using Sox6 antibody. Figure 4 shows that the epsilony proximal promoter is readily immunoprecipitated with Sox6 antibody in both MEL cells and liver cells. Normal IgG was used as a negative control (Figure 4A). The above data (Figures 3 and 4) clearly indicate that Sox6 acts as a repressor of the epsilony gene by directly binding to the epsilony promoter, probably as a dimer.",

To determine whether the persistent expression of epsilony globin is due to residual primitive erythrocytes or is due to ectopic expression of epsilony globin in definitive erythrocytes, we examined the spatial pattern of epsilony globin transcripts in mouse embryos by in situ hybridization (Figure 5). As expected, epsilony globin is not expressed in the WT 14.5-dpc liver, the site of definitive erythropoiesis in the fetus. In contrast, abundant ectopic epsilony mRNA expression is seen in the liver of 14.5-dpc mutants (Figure 5 A-D). However, the expression of betamaj/min globin is equally abundant in both WT and p100H mutant mice (Figure 5 E and F). These data demonstrate that the persistent high levels of epsilony are due to ectopic expression in the definitive erythroid cells that mature in the fetal liver, suggesting that there is an intrinsic defect of the epsilony silencing mechanism in Sox6-null mice.",

As shown in Figure 6A, Sox6 is detectable by Northern blot beginning at 10.5 dpc, coincident with the temporal onset of definitive erythropoiesis in the liver. Furthermore, in situ hybridization shows that Sox6 is highly transcribed in 12.5-dpc liver, but not in yolk sac blood islands at 7.5 dpc (Figure 6B). Therefore, Sox6 expression is temporally and spatially coincident with definitive, but not primitive, erythropoiesis.

        "inputsentence": "In this report, we show that Sox6 is a novel factor in the complicated regulation mechanism of globin genes. In the Sox6 null mouse, there is a transient effect on the embryonic globin genes, zeta and betaH1, and a persistent upregulation of the epsilony globin gene. Sox6 directly regulates and binds to the proximal promoter of epsilony gene and represses the epsilony-globin gene in definitive erythropoiesis.\nSox6 belongs to group D of the Sox family of proteins that includes Sox5, 12, 13, and 23 [34]. Group D Sox proteins contain a coiled-coiled domain that mediates homo- and heterodimerization [6,35]. Functionally, dimerization of Sox5 and Sox6 has been shown to greatly increase the binding efficiency of the two Sox proteins to DNA that contains adjacent Sox sites [6]. In addition, Sox6 binds more strongly to an HMG-box dimer motif than to a single HMG-box motif [5]. Therefore, it appears that target genes for group D Sox proteins, such as Sox6, probably harbor pairs of HMG binding sites with a configuration compatible with binding of D-Sox protein dimers. Indeed, in the present study, the defined Sox6 target sequence of the epsilony promoter contains two Sox/Sox6 consensus sites (Figure 3A). Functionally, both sites are essential for Sox6 binding to the epsilony promoter and repression of its activity (Figure 3E and 3F). These observations suggest that Sox6 binds to this sequence of the epsilony promoter either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other Sox proteins. Because Sox proteins recognize a short 6-bp core-binding sequence that allows for considerable degeneracy, the specificity of their actions is thought to rely upon interactions with other transcription factors [36]. In our EMSAs, we had to run the electrophoresis on a 4%-6% gel for at least 4-8 h to detect the Sox6-associated band, suggesting that Sox6 is part of a high molecular weight complex. A few other epsilony globin repressors have been reported to bind to DNA sequences near the Sox/Sox6 consensus sites, including the DRED complex [37] and COUP-TF [38]. Sox6 might interact with these factors and form a large repression complex. Identification of other components of the Sox6-containing complex associated with the epsilony promoter will shed light on its mechanism of repression.\nSox proteins bind and bend linear DNA by partial intercalation in the minor groove, and can also bind to four-way junctions [2-4]. Therefore, one attractive model to explain how Sox6 proteins control gene expression is that they function as architectural factors bound to DNA, influencing local chromatin structure by bending DNA and by assembling multiprotein transcriptional complexes. By changing the local chromatin structure, Sox6 could either interfere with binding of other activators to the promoter or facilitate binding of other repressors. Another example of a repressor that interferes with an activator on the epsilony promoter is DRED. DRED interferes with EKLF, an activator, in binding to the epsilony promoter [39]. Two HMG architectural proteins (distantly related to the Sox family of transcription factors), HMG-I and HMG-Y, were demonstrated to bind to the human adult beta globin silencers (silencers I and II) and cause bending of the DNA, facilitating the binding of other repressors [40].\nSox6 expression is temporally and spatially coincident with definitive (but not primitive) erythropoiesis (Figure 6), and Sox6 represses epsilony globin expression both in vivo (Figure 1) and in vitro (Figure 2). Moreover, in situ hybridization clearly shows that the persistent expression of epsilony globin in p100H mutant mice is due to defects in the silencing mechanism of definitive erythropoiesis that takes place in the liver (Figure 5). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis to silence epsilony globin expression.\nThe expression level of epsilony globin in homozygous Sox6 null mice at 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc is statistically equivalent to the level of betamaj/min expression in the livers of 15.5-dpc and 18.5-dpc homozygous WT mice (Figure 1). This demonstrates that ectopic expression of the epsilony globin gene is quite robust in homozygous mutant mice. The expression levels of two other embryonic globin genes (zeta and betah1) are also higher in p100H homozygotes, compared with WT. Like epsilony, levels of zeta and betah1 are dramatically higher in mutant mice at 15.5 dpc. However, unlike epsilony globin, zeta and betah1 decline in expression by day 18.5 dpc (Figure 1), suggesting that epsilony is regulated differently than zeta and betah1. It is possible that Sox6 has a general effect on embryonic globin genes (and erythrocyte maturation) in addition to a specific role in silencing epsilony.\nAlthough most p100H mutant mice die just after being born, a rare few survive longer. None have been observed to live longer than 2 wk after birth [14]. We examined a single archived sample of liver RNA from a mutant mouse on postnatal day 13.5 for globin gene expression and detected high levels of epsilony globin in this RNA sample, compared with undetectable epsilony RNA in WT control mice. At this point in development, the levels of zeta and betah1 RNA were undetectable both in mutant and WT; however, adult beta-like globin RNA levels were moderately elevated in the mutant RNA compared with WT (unpublished data), similar to what we observe at 18.5 dpc (Figure 1). These findings suggest that Sox6 continues to function postnatally to silence epsilony globin expression and has a unique function in the regulation of epsilony-globin. The mechanism by which Sox6 regulates the other embryonic globin genes remains to be elucidated.\nSox6 has other effects in erythropoiesis, including a delay in enucleation/maturation in p100H mutant mice. This may be the result of indirect effects, such as stress-induced proliferation (resulting from cardiac defects) and/or anemia. Severe anemia can lead to rapid premature release of red cells, prior to their complete maturation. However, the hematocrit of 18.5-dpc mutant mice is only 20% lower than that of WT (unpublished data), and this mild anemia is probably not sufficient to explain the extent of nucleated red cells. Alternatively, Sox6 itself may play a role in red cell terminal differentiation, as it has been shown to be an important factor in cardiac [15], neuronal [10], astrocytic [11], and cartilage differentiation programs [32,41-44].\nThe restoration of normal enucleation of red cells in Sox6-deficient mouse by postnatal day 10.5 may result from functional compensation of other Sox proteins (expressed at later developmental stages), since functional redundancy is a recurring theme with Sox proteins [13,45,46]. Moreover, erythropoiesis has already shifted from fetal liver to bone marrow by postnatal day 10.5. The accompanying change in the microenvironment of red cell production may permit normal enucleation. Identification of Sox6 downstream target genes and its interacting proteins will shed light on the role of Sox6 in red cell terminal differentiation and the enucleation process.\nRecently, in vivo and in vitro analyses suggest that reactivation of human epsilon-globin would be therapeutically beneficial to adults with sickle cell disease [47], providing a rationale for detailed investigations into the molecular basis of epsilon-globin gene silencing. The present study identifies a novel repressor, Sox6, which binds to the epsilony proximal promoter, potentially as part of a larger repression complex. Because murine Sox6 and its human counterpart are 94% identical at the amino acid level [48], it is possible that human Sox6 may also be important in human epsilon globin silencing. There is significant sequence homology between the human and mouse epsilon promoter regions, and the human promoter contains at least two potential Sox6 binding sites. Indeed, the existence of a silencer of the human epsilon globin gene has been proposed [49,50]. Thus, elucidation of the Sox6 repression mechanism and identification of other components of the Sox6-containing complex may further our understanding of epsilon globin regulation and potentially reveal additional molecular targets for the treatment of sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemias.",

Nucleotide numbering is relative to the transcription start site. The transcriptional start site is based on the longest cDNA in the Fantom (Functional Annotation of Mouse) database. The PCR primers contained XhoI and HindIII sites that were used to clone the epsilony promoter fragment upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in pGL3 Basic (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). A 2.5-kb SstI/XhoI fragment of muLCRbeta 9.3 (micro LCR; [31]) was then inserted upstream of the epsilony promoter in the above pGL3 Basic plasmid, resulting in a reporter construct in which luciferase expression is driven by the epsilony promoter.

Employing a comprehensive methodological approach, the aim of our in vitro study was to elucidate novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of human peripheral blood immune cells mediated by a fungal beta-1 to 3-D-glucan, i.e. glucan phosphate, in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1).\nResults\nDespite an activation of nuclear factor (NF)kappaB, NFinterleukin(IL)-6 and NFAT similar to LPS or TSST-1, we observed no significant production of IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma induced by glucan phosphate. Glucan phosphate-treated leukocytes induced a substantial amount of IL-8 (peak at 18 h: 5000 pg/ml), likely due to binding of NFkappaB to a consensus site in the IL-8 promoter. An increase in IL-1receptor antagonist(RA) production (peak at 24 h: 12000 pg/ml) by glucan phosphate-treated cells positively correlated with IL-8 levels. Glucan phosphate induced significant binding to a known NFIL-6 site and a new NFAT site within the IL-1RA promoter, which was confirmed by inhibition experiments. When applied in combination with either LPS or TSST-1 at the same time points, we detected that glucan phosphate elevated the LPS- and the TSST-1-induced DNA binding of NFkappaB, NFIL-6 and NFAT, leading to a synergistic increase of IL-1RA. Further, glucan phosphate modulated the TSST-1-induced inflammatory response via reduction of IL-1beta and IL-6. As a consequence, glucan phosphate shifted the TSST-1-induced IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Subsequently, glucan phosphate decreased the TSST-1-induced, IL-1-dependent production of IL-2.\nConclusion\nThus, beta-1 to 3-D-glucans may induce beneficial effects in the presence of pro-inflammatory responses, downstream of receptor binding and signaling by switching a pro- to an anti-inflammatory IL-1RA-mediated reaction. Our results also offer new insights into the complex regulation of the IL-1RA gene, which can be modulated by a beta-1 to 3-D-glucan.",

        "inputsentence": "beta-1 to 3-D-glucans occur as a principal component of microbial cell walls or can be secreted from both, non-pathogenic and pathogenic fungi such as S. cerevisae and C. albicans [1]. These beta-1 to 3-D-linked glucose polymers are characterized as a fungal pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) [2]. The primary cellular recognition of beta-1 to 3-D-glucans is mediated by several beta-1 to 3-D-glucan receptors on phagocytes [3,4] and other cells [5,6]. Human as well as murine Dectin-1 has been demonstrated to be the major pattern recognition receptor (PRR) for intact yeast and beta-1 to 3-D-glucan-containing particles (i.e. zymosan) on monocytes/macrophages as well as neutrophils and on primary cells [7-11]. In the murine system, binding of zymosan to Dectin-1 resulted in production of TNFalpha through Toll-like receptor 2 and the adaptor protein MyD88 [12]. Another water-soluble beta-1 to 3-D-glucan (PGG-glucan) has been described to activate NFkappaB and NFIL-6 in murine cell lines [13,14]. Similarly, it has been shown that beta-1 to 3-D-glucans activate NFkappaB in a human monocyte-like cell line [15] and in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), in the latter case without secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNFalpha) [16]. One study proposed that the production of the anti-inflammatory IL-1RA, but not IL-1 by human monocytes may be a potentially protective mechanism induced by beta-1 to 3-D-glucan [17]. Three other investigations have reported that human leukocytes and human vascular endothelial cells produce IL-8 in response to zymosan [18] or a water-soluble beta-1 to 3-D-glucan [6,19].\nIn addition, beta-1 to 3-D-glucans seem to be able to modify the response to pro-inflammatory stimuli or even sepsis. In a murine polymicrobial sepsis model, beta-1 to 3-D-glucan [20] treatment resulted in decreased septic morbidity and mortality mediated via inhibition of NFkappaB and stimulation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway [21,22]. These and other animal studies [23,24] as well as a clinical trial [25] support a protective role of beta-1 to 3-D-glucan in certain pro-inflammatory conditions. The mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects of beta-1 to 3-D-glucan are only partially resolved, especially in humans. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms of beta-1 to 3-D-glucans on human leukocytes in pro-inflammatory conditions with special emphasis on the cytokine profile and its transcriptional regulation. For this purpose, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were exposed to a well-defined beta-1 to 3-D-glucan, i.e. glucan phosphate (GP) [20,26], alone or simultaneously with LPS from gram-negative bacteria or the superantigen TSST-1 from gram-positive bacteria over 48 h. Because of the potential effect of beta-1 to 3-D-glucan on cytokine production [12,16-19], TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1RA were measured as well as IFNgamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and TGFbeta1. Correspondingly, four NFkappaB sites from the TNFalpha promoter (kappa consensus, kappa1, kappa2, kappa3) [27], a kappa consensus site from the IL-8 promoter [28], an NFAT site from the IFNgamma promoter (ATP2) [29] and a consensus NFIL-6 site from the IL-6 promoter [13] were examined. Because of the anti-inflammatory role of IL-1RA, we focused on binding of transcription factors to the IL-1RA promoter. An inhibitory element and three positive-acting LPS-response elements (LRE-1, LRE-2 and LRE-3) in the IL-1RA promoter, including NFkappaB, PU.1 and NFIL-6 sites, have been characterized previously [30-33]. Using computational analysis for homology search [34], we looked for new binding motifs in the IL-1RA promoter.",

Previous studies reported that beta-1 to 3-D-glucans induced only a limited cytokine secretion of human blood cells [15-18]. Corroborating and extending these singular findings in terms of examining pro- (eight) as well as anti- (three) inflammatory cytokines over time (48 h) and six additional transcription factor binding sites, our comprehensive analysis revealed the following cytokine profile of human leukocytes in response to a highly purified water soluble beta-1 to 3-D-glucan and in comparison to two pro-inflammatory mediators (LPS, TSST-1):\n(i) IL-1beta\nThere was no IL-1beta production detectable following PBMC treatment with 1 nor 100 mug GP. An insignificant up-regulation of IL-1beta production for GP + LPS was observed in comparison with LPS. For GP + TSST-1 we found a significant reduction in IL-1beta from 18 h - 24 h, for the latter by about 40% when compared to TSST-1 or the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc. (n = 6; both p = 0.01). On the whole, GP mediated a reduction of the TSST-1-induced amount of IL-1beta by about 50% (Fig. 3A).\n(ii) IL-6\nGP induced only a small amount of IL-6 and there was no significant alteration of the LPS-induced IL-6 production by GP. On the contrary, we observed a decreased IL-6 production for GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc., especially at 24 h by about 40% (n = 5; both p = 0.02), (data not shown in detail).\n(iii) IL-8\nWe found that GP induced a substantial IL-8 production, in comparison with medium control, especially at 24 h (n = 13; p < 0.01). A combination of GP and LPS resulted in a non-significant increase of IL-8 production when compared to LPS or GP/LPS calc.

When compared to LPS stimulation or GP/LPS calc., GP + LPS did not alter the kinetic course of the IL-1RA production. However, following GP + TSST-1 we found a synergistic increase in IL-1RA production from 18 h to 48 h, when compared to TSST-1 (for instance at 24 h: n = 6; p = 0.01) or to the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc. (from 18 h to 36 h). Over the time course of 48 h, GP elevated the TSST-1-induced amount of IL-1RA by approximately 200% (Fig. 3B).\nPositive correlation between GP-induced IL-8 and IL-1RA productions. Following stimulation with GP (24 h), we observed a positive correlation between IL-8 and IL-1RA. Moreover, we found this correlation to be dose-dependent, since 100 mug of GP induced larger amounts of IL-8 and IL-1RA than 1 mug GP (n = 5, p <= 0.002, r = 0.9 and 0.98, respectively).\n(v) TNFalpha\nWith respect to TNFalpha production, 100 mug of GP yielded minor, statistically not distinguishable amounts, when compared to medium control.

        "inputsentence": "Animal models of sepsis and myocardial injury suggest that a beta-1 to 3-D-glucan like GP mediates its protective mechanisms, in part, via a rapid shift from NFkappaB- to PI3K-signaling [22,37]. Our study provides novel evidence that downstream of recognition and signaling pro-inflammatory transcription factor binding and cytokine expression of human leukocytes is switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype by GP.\nWe confirmed and extended previous results [13-16] indicating that, in the absence of other stimuli, beta-1 to 3-D-glucans induced binding of NFkappaB-, NFIL-6- and NFAT-mers to cytokine promoters. Because of the multiple band shifts observed for NFAT binding (Fig. 1A), one could speculate that there is activation of several different NFAT isoforms, probably derived from alternative splicing [38]. Interestingly, the GP-induced transcription factor binding transformed only into a very limited cytokine response, namely IL-8 and IL-1RA (Fig. 3B). Hence, our data are in aggreement with the few reports describing a beta-1 to 3-D-glucan-mediated IL-8 [6,16,19] and IL-1RA production [17]. In addition, our EMSA/supershift and immunoblotting results demonstrated a GP-mediated predominant binding of NFkappaB p65 and to a lesser extent of p50 to a kappaB consensus site of the IL-8 promoter (Figs. 1A, 2). Results by Schulte and colleagues [28] pointed to an induction of IL-8 transcription depending on activation via an NFkappaB p65/65 homodimer, rather than via p65/50 heterodimers, which might be the case for the GP-mediated IL-8 transcription. A GP-mediated IL-8 transcription based upon a cooperation between transactivated NFkappaB p65 and NFIL-6 [13,39] or NFATc2 dimer binding to the IL-8kappaB site [38] seems also possible. The IL-8kappaB consensus site exhibits a preferentially p65 binding half site and thus differs from the kappaB half site described for TNFalpha and IL-1beta [27,40], supporting the idea of regulating NFkappaB binding through combinatorial associations of the subunits and the specific sequence of the decameric kappaB motif [41,42]. Unlike LPS or TSST-1, we found that GP did not induce IL-1beta, but it strongly induced IL-1RA, suggesting an immediate anti-inflammatory potential of GP. Analysing the IL-1RA promoter [34], we discovered four new binding sites (Fig. 8): an NFkappaB3 site (between -100 and -130), an NFkappaB consensus site (-266 and -280), another NFkappaB2/3 site (-288 and -302) and a more distal NFATP2/3 site (-471 and -490). Our data indicated that GP leads to production of IL-1RA primarily via induction of NFATP2/3 and NFIL-6 DNA binding, which might be due to differences in the binding motif or the composition of the activated transcription factors (NFAT) between the IFNgamma, IL-6 and IL-1RA promoter. The differential decrease of NFkappaB, NFAT and NFIL-6 binding to sites in the IL-1RA promoter as well as of IL-1RA mRNA and protein induced by selective inhibitors prior to GP treatment might suggest that these steps are linked to each other and necessary for induction of IL-1RA (Fig. 7). Regarding cellular sources, both, monocytes as well as neutrophils have been reported to produce IL-1RA [32]. Flow cytometric experiments seemed to confirm that monocytes and neutrophils were able to produce IL-8 just as IL-1RA in response to GP (data not shown). This GP-induced cytokine profile was substantially more restricted than that of LPS or TSST-1, which is likely due to differences in recognition and signaling between LPS, TSST-1 and GP. Recognition of LPS is mainly mediated through Toll-like receptor 4 and subsequent signaling via the NFkappaB pathway, leading to expression of pro-inflammatory mediators like TNFalpha [43]. A bacterial superantigen like TSST-1 acts through binding to MHC-II molecules and subsequently the T cell receptor, leading to release of mainly IFNgamma and TNFalpha, the latter via both, PI3K and p38 mitogen-activated kinase signaling [44,45]. Altogether, the induction of the neutrophil-attracting IL-8 and the anti-inflammatory IL-1RA by fungal carbohydrates (GP) may well fit to a benign PAMP response, mounting defensive mechanisms against a possible microbial attack.\nPotentially even more relevant than the specific cytokine panel induced by GP, we found that, in the presence of other stimuli (LPS or TSST-1), GP ameliorated their pro-inflammatory immune reactions, similar to the effects in murine models of sepsis and inflammation [21-24]. Mainly, GP altered the TSST-1-induced IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory profile via down-regulation of IL-1beta and IL-6, at the same time there was a synergistic up-regulation of IL-1RA. In part, this change may be caused by GP-mediated modulations of the TSST-1 induced binding of NFkappaB, NFIL-6 and NFAT to known and up to now unknown sites within the IL-8 and IL-1RA promoter instead of the TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 or IFNgamma promoter. Accordingly, we found that the TSST-1-induced binding of NFkappaB to sites from the TNFalpha promoter negatively correlated with the GP-mediated enhancement of the TSST-1-induced IL-1RA production (r = -0.88; p < 0.01; data not shown in detail). Of the four examined NFkappaB sites from the IL-1RA promoter, mostly the TSST-1- and LPS-induced binding to the NFkappaB3 and the TSST-1-induced binding to the new NFkappaB consensus site seemed to be increased by GP. So, while we observed a GP-mediated down-regulation of the LPS- and the TSST-1-induced NFkappaB binding to sites of the TNFalpha promoter, there was an up-regulation to NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus sites of the IL-1RA promoter. These seemingly contradictory data could be explained by differences in either NFkappaB subunits or conserved nucleotides (#1, 2, 3, 10) within the decameric NFkappaB binding motif between the TNFalpha and the IL-1RA promoter (for NFkappaB3 the IL-1RA motif contains a T on position 10 instead of the conserved C in the TNFalpha motif, see Table 1), probably leading to differences in binding [41,42]. Despite the location of the new NFkappaB consensus site (-266 and -280) in the inhibitory element (-250 and -294) of the IL-1RA promoter [30], we observed no inhibition. On the other side, we found an inhibitory NFkappaB2/3 site (-288 and -302) towards the end of the inhibitory element, demonstrating down-regulations of the LPS- and TSST-1-induced binding, which could not be altered by GP. In our opinion, this site may therefore represent at least a part of the previoulsy described inhibitory element [30]. The GP-modulated increase in TSST-1-induced binding to the new NFkappaB3 and NFkappaB consensus site, the NFIL-6 site [32] as well as to the novel NFATP2/3 site may explain the synergistic up-regulation of the TSST-1-induced IL-1RA production. We think that this GP-modulated activation of transcription was reflected by the decrease of the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio following GP + TSST-1 (Fig. 6). In this context, it has been postulated that in vitro a 100fold excess of IL-1RA over IL-1beta might control the biological effects of IL-1 [46,47]. Since, in fact, the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio following GP + TSST-1 is partially less than 0.01, it is not unreasonable to assume that IL-1beta bioactivity is inactivated in our system. Indeed, GP reduced the TSST-1-induced, IL-1-dependent IL-2 production of murine EL-4 cells (data not shown in detail).\nThe weaker modulating effects of GP on the LPS-induced immune response observed in this study, may be attributed to delicately balanced differences in signaling pathways between LPS and TSST-1 [43-45]. TSST-1 has been shown to use the PI3K pathway for signaling [44] and this effect may be sustained by GP treatment [22,37]. It has been demonstrated that in septic/LPS-adapted leukocytes the PI3K pathway selectively controls sIL-1RA but not IL-1beta production [48]. Signaling via PI3K has been reported to be involved in the activation of NFAT in T cells [49]. Activation of NFkappaB can also take place via PI3K [50], which may offer an explanation for a difference in signaling between GP (PI3K) and LPS (mitogen-activated kinase signaling). This idea may be supported by another study showing that despite the use of similar PRR, LPS and peptidoglycan activated the IL-1RA gene through different mechanisms/DNA-binding proteins and acted synergistically in combination, suggestive of signals which are not equivalent in all parts [51].",

Our results also generated new insights into a very complex interplay of transcription factor binding to various known and newly identified sites in the IL-1RA promoter (Fig. 8), which can be regulated differentially by a fungal carbohydrate. Together with the in vivo studies [22,37], our findings might support the concept of protective effects mediated by glucan phosphate in pro-inflammatory conditions, especially with a dysregulated IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio [52,53].",

Toll-like receptor 4- (TLR4-) mediated nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) signaling plays critical roles in the activation and regulation of inflammatory responses in injured brain. However, the involvement of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling in the pathogenesis of ICH remains unknown. The present study was to evaluate the temporal profile of the expression of TLR4 and the activation of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling in brain tissues of Wistar rats after ICH. TLR4 mRNA and protein, the phosphorylation of inhibitors of kappa B (p-IkappaBalpha), and the activity of NFkappaB were examined in hemorrhagic cerebral tissue by Rt-PCR, Western blots, immunohistochemistry staining, and EMSA. Compared with saline control, the TLR4 mRNA and protein significantly increased starting at 6 hours after ICH, peaked on the 3rd day after ICH, and then decreased but still maintained at a higher level on the 7th day after ICH (P < .05). The level of p-IkappaBalpha and the activity of NFkappaB also increased in the brain after ICH compared with saline control. The present study firstly suggests that TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling participates in the pathogenesis of ICH, which may become a therapeutic target for ICH-induced brain damage.",

        "inputsentence": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) represents 10%-15% of all strokes and occurs with increasing frequency as a complication of the thrombolytic treatment of ischemic stroke, which is associated with high mortality and severe disability in survivors [1, 2]. Local brain tissue deformation induces primary brain damage after ICH; more importantly, the excitotoxicity and inflammatory responses in the brain tissue induced by ICH result in further brain damage following ICH [3]. Both innate and adaptive immunological/inflammatory mechanisms have been clearly shown to participate in the progression of brain injury after ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, how the inflammatory responses in ICH are triggered and regulated remains to be elucidated.\nTLRs are a family of transmembrane proteins and act as signal transduction molecules [4]. Activation of TLRs recruits downstream signaling proteins and results in transcription of genes encoding inflammation-associated molecules and cytokines [5, 6]. For example, combined with specific ligand, the activation of TLR4 induces the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B (IkappaB) and dissociates IkappaB from NF-kappa-B (NFkappaB). Then, NFkappaB trans-locates into the nucleus and activates and regulates the transcription of genes related to inflammatory responses [5, 6]. TLRs play a critical role in the induction of immunological/inflammatory responses and are implicated in several CNS diseases, such as infectious disease, autoimmune disease, and ischemic brain injury [7, 8]. Accumulating evidences demonstrate that TLR4, the first mammalian TLR recognized, contributes to the neuronal death, blood brain barrier damage, brain edema, and inflammatory responses in the brain injury induced by ischemia [8, 9]. However, little is known about TLR4 in the brain after ICH. In the present study, we detected the transcription of TLR4 gene and the activation of TLR4-mediated signaling in the rat brains subjected to experimental ICH.

        "inputsentence": "Intra-cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) represents 10-15% of all strokes, and occurs with increasing frequency as a complication of the thrombolytic treatment of ischemic stroke [1]. The mortality of ICH is higher than that of ischemic stroke. Only 31% are functionally independent at 3 months. Only 38% of the patients survive the 1st year [10]. Unfortunately, the method for treatment of this disease and protection of the brain tissue after ICH are not effective. Mass effect, ischemia, and toxicity of blood components after ICH induce brain tissue damage. In addition, there is increasing evidence that inflammatory processes are involved in cerebrovascular events. After ICH, inflammatory mediators from the blood might enter to the brain and induce an inflammatory reaction and the brain cells itself are also capable of producing many of these agents [11]. The inflammatory responses are responsible for the ICH induced brain injury, which could provide new therapeutic targets for ICH. Various constituents of the inflammatory response, including adhesion molecules, cytokines, leukocytes, immunoglobulins, and complement, may be important in the pathogenesis of ICH. However, how the inflammatory responses is activated and regulated in the brain tissue after ICH is unclear.\nTranscription factor nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFkappaB) is an important nuclear transcription factor, which initiates transcription of genes associated with immune responses and inflammation [12, 13] and also plays a key role in regulating inflammation in brain pathologies. It has been reported that NFkappaB increased in the region of perihematoma after ICH [14]. NFkappaB activation occurs within minutes and persists for at least a week in response to ICH, which is associated with the expression of selected target genes [15]. Activation of NFkappaB initiates inflammatory responses and contributes to the pathobiology of perilesional cell death after ICH [16]. Inhibition of NFkappaB activity has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on experimental ICH, such as reduce inflammation, behavioral dysfunction, and neuronal damage produced by ICH [17]. The knowledge about how NFkappaB is activated in the brain subjected to ICH is critical for seeking a new neuroprotective method for ICH.\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of signal transduction molecules and play a critical role in the induction of innate and adaptive immunity [4]. TLR-mediated signaling pathways mainly stimulate the activation of NFkappaB [12, 13]. TLR4, the first mammalian TLR recognized, has been reported to be involved in several central nervous (CNS) system diseases, such as inflammatory or autoimmune CNS diseases and cerebral ischemic injury [7, 8]. Although previous reports indicated that the activation of NFkappaB was attributed to the oxidative stress or glutamate receptor activation induced by red blood cells and/or plasma constituents [17], very few studies have been directed to investigate the role and the relationship between TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling and ICH.\nIn the present study, we established the rat model of experimental ICH and detected the TLR4 mRNA and protein. Our data showed that transcription of TLR4 as well as the expression of TLR4 protein after ICH significantly elevated in brain tissue. These changes started as early as 6 hours after the ICH insult and maintained at a high level for 7 days afterward. The TLR4 protein, detected by immunohistochemistry, was consistently distributed in peri-hemorrhage areas, the hippocampus, cortex, thalamic nuclei, and some white matter tracts. These data indicated that increased expression of TLR4 may be related to the triggering of the inflammatory responses in the brain tissue after ICH.\nRecent studies demonstrated that ICH initiates inflammatory responses, which are associated with secondary growth of hemorrhage and cell death [18]. It is now believed that TLR4-mediated-NFkappaB pathway activates and regulates immunological and inflammatory responses. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the increased inflammatory responses in the brain after ICH, in the present study, we evaluated the activation of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling by detecting the p-IkappaB and the activity of NFkappaB in hemorrhagic brains. NFkappaB is an important transcription factor downstream in the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway. Activation of TLR4 stimulates IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, resulting in nuclear translocation of NFkappaB, which initiates transcription of genes associated with innate immune responses and inflammation [5, 6]. We observed that the levels of phosphorylation of IkappaB and the activity of NFkappaB were significantly increased in brain tissue after ICH. The temporal profile of the expression of p-IkappaB and the activation of NFkappaB was similar to that of the expression of TLR4. Our data suggest that ICH stimulates activation of the TLR4/NFkappaB signaling pathway, which is consistent with previous reports that activation of NFkappaB is regulated through the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway. TLR4 plays an important role in the recognition of microbial components [19, 20] and can also recognize endogenous molecules such as the degradation products of macromolecules, products of proteolytic cascades, intracellular components of ruptured cells, and products of genes that are activated by inflammation. For instance, HSP70, HSP32, HSP27, and enzymes involved in oxidative stress are found to be upregulated in the brain after ICH, which may be produced by injured neuronal cells or blood cells [21]. It may be speculated that these molecules produced in damaged brain or came from blood cells and constituents of plasma server as endogenous TLR4 ligands, activate TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and initiate the inflammatory responses in IHC brain. However, the specific endogenous ligands for TLR4 in hemorrhagic brain have not been determined and need to be identified through further research.\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrated the temporal profile of the activation of TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling in brain tissue in a rat model of experimental ICH, which suggests that TLR4-mediated NFkappaB signaling participates in the pathogenesis of ICH, which may be a therapeutic target for the prevention of ICH-induced brain damage.",

        "inputsentence": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory arthritis, affecting up to 1% of the adult population. RA is characterised by a symmetrical polyarthritis in which chronic inflammation of joints is associated with a progressive destruction of cartilage and bone, leading to functional decline and disability. Infiltration of cells of the innate and adaptive immune system into the joint space drives the local production of proinflammatory T-helper type 1 and T-helper type 17 cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases by infiltrating monocytes and synovial cells. Proliferation of synovial fibroblasts leads to the formation of pannus tissue, which invades and degrades articular cartilage and subchondral bone.\nThe aetiology of RA is still not understood, but it is well accepted that activation of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression plays a key role in the development of RA and many other autoimmune diseases. NF-kappaB represents a family of structurally related and evolutionarily conserved proteins (p100 or NF-kappaB2, p105 or NF-kappaB1, p65 or RelA, RelB, c-Rel) that function as homodimers or heterodimers [1], and that regulate the expression of a large number of genes - such as TNF, IL-1, IL-6, cyclo-oxygenase-2, chemokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and matrix metalloproteinases - that are involved in RA. In addition, TNF and IL-1 are themselves very potent activators of NF-kappaB (reviewed in [2,3]).\nNF-kappaB activation can be detected in cultured synovial fibroblasts and synovial tissue from RA patients, and animal models of inflammatory arthritis also demonstrate the active role of NF-kappaB in the development and progression of RA (reviewed in [4]). The time course of NF-kappaB activation appears to precede the onset of disease, and blockade of NF-kappaB by different means decreases disease severity [5,6].\nNext to its role in proinflammatory gene expression, NF-kappaB is also essential for osteoclastogenesis, mainly by mediating the effects of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL). Defects in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis are the major cause of bone erosion in osteolytic diseases such as RA [7].\nFinally, recent discoveries revealing a genetic association with several genes relevant to NF-kappaB signalling, including CD40, TRAF1, TNFAIP3, and c-REL, further highlight the importance of NF-kappaB activation in RA pathogenesis [8].",

        "inputsentence": "Since NF-kappaB is central to the process of inflammation in RA, much research deals with the identification of the molecular triggers that activate NF-kappaB in RA. It is well accepted that proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 play an important role, and administration of TNF antagonists is an effective treatment for severe RA (reviewed in [9]). TNF and IL-1 are both very potent activators of NF-kappaB and it can be expected that NF-kappaB activation by these cytokines mediates most of their pro-inflammatory activities in RA (reviewed in [3]).\nNF-kappaB activation by receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK), a TNF receptor family member, is important for osteoclastogenesis, and defects in proper RANK-NF-kappaB signalling are likely to be involved in RA pathology and other diseases associated with bone loss [7]. CD40 is another TNF receptor family member that is functionally expressed on a variety of cell types, including smooth muscle fibroblasts from normal and RA patients and RA synovial cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and can be upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines including TNF [10]. Binding of the CD40 ligand (CD154), which is transiently expressed on the surface of activated CD4+ T cells, triggers NF-kappaB activation resulting in fibroblast proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contributes to joint destruction. However, studies with antagonistic anti-CD40 or anti-CD154 antibodies led to the conclusion that CD40 signals may be important at the initial stages of arthritis induction, but are not required once disease is established and pathogenic antibodies are already present [11,12]. Enhanced expression of the TNF receptor family member B-cell activating factor (BAFF), allowing the survival of autoantibody- producing B lymphocytes, is also characteristic for RA, and antagonists of BAFF have been developed to counter RA [13]. Finally, lymphotoxin beta receptor signalling has been implicated in tertiary lymphoid organ formation at sites of chronic inflammation including RA [13].\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) have been implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases and are potential candidates for inducing NF-kappaB-dependent inflammation in RA. In addition to microbial ligands, an increasing number of endogenous ligands - a group of proteins derived from host tissues and cells - have been reported as candidate activators of TLRs inducing so-called sterile inflammation (reviewed in [14,15]). TLRs are expressed in RA synovial tissues and various endogenous ligands are present within the inflamed joints of RA patients. Moreover, animal models using TLR knockout mice or strategies to block TLR signalling clearly identify TLR-dependent inflammation as being important in the pathogenesis of the disease.\nHigh mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1), a highly conserved chromatin component that can be actively secreted by macrophages or passively released by necrotic cells, is one of the most putative endogenous TLR4 ligands involved in RA pathology. HMGB1 is increased in RA synovial tissue and HMGB1 neutralising antibodies or the antagonistic BoxA domain of HMGB1 protect against collagen-induced arthritis in mice [16]. Myeloid-related protein 8 and myeloid-related protein 14, damage-associated molecular pattern molecules belonging to the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, are also abundantly present in RA synovial fluid, and have been suggested to be involved in TLR4-induced chronic inflammation in RA [17,18]. Other endogenous TLR ligands that may be involved in RA pathology are extracellular matrix components such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, biglycan, tenascin C, and hyal-uronic acid fragments (reviewed in [14,15]). Together, these studies suggest that several TLR ligands in the inflamed joint tissue may contribute to NF-kappaB activation and inflammatory gene expression in RA.",

        "inputsentence": "NF-kappaB proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm as latent complexes by inhibitory proteins referred to as inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) proteins, which prevent NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and DNA binding [19]. Whereas the majority of IkappaBs (IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, IkappaBepsilon, p105 (also known as NF-kappaB1), p100 (also known as NF-kappaB2)) serve as inhibitors of NF-kappaB, IkappaBxi and Bcl-3 instead potentiate NF-kappaB transactivation in the nucleus. p100 and p105 are precursors of the p52 and p50 NF-kappaB subunits, respectively. There are two unique NF-kappaB signalling pathways, termed canonical (or classical) and noncanonical (or alternative) NF-kappaB pathways.\nThe canonical NF-kappaB pathway plays a major role in innate and adaptive immunity, and is triggered by many stimuli including proinflammatory cytokines (for example, TNF, IL-1), antigens, RANKL, and TLR ligands. NF-kappaB signalling initiated by different receptors requires the formation of proximal protein-protein interactions that are often receptor specific, but ultimately converge in the activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, which mediates phosphorylation of the inhibitory IkappaB protein leading to its K48-polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome [20]. The IKK complex is comprised of the two catalytic subunits IKK1 and IKK2 (also known as IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and the regulatory subunit NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO - also known as IKKgamma) (Figure 1). Gene targeting experiments showed that IKK2 and NEMO, but not IKK1, are required for canonical NF-kappaB activation [21].\nOne of the best studied NF-kappaB signalling pathways is the TNF pathway. TNF stimulation results in the recruitment of TNF receptor-1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein and of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), which function as adaptor proteins for the E3 ubiquitin ligases TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2 and TRAF5, which in turn bind the E3 ubiquitin ligases cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) 1 and cIAP2 (Figure 1). On TNF stimulation, TNF-receptor bound RIP1 is rapidly modified by K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. TRAF2/5 and cIAP1/2 are good candidates for RIP1 ubiquitination, but the specific role of each is still unclear. The polyubiquitin chains on RIP1 are believed to create a scaffold to recruit the IKK and TAK1 complex via the ubiquitin-binding proteins NEMO and TAB1/2, respectively. The recent identification of a distinct E2/E3 enzyme complex that modifies NEMO with linear polyubiquitin chains and is essential for TNF-activated NF-kappaB signalling adds further complexity [22]. The exact role of protein-anchored polyubiquitin chains remains unclear, as it was recently suggested that unanchored polyubiquitin chains can directly activate the TAK1 complex [23].\nSimilar signalling principles apply to other receptors. For example, TLR4 stimulation by lipopolysaccharide induces the recruitment of Toll/IL-1 receptor adaptor protein (also referred to as Mal) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), which most probably serve as bridging factors to recruit myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFNbeta (TRIF), respectively. MyD88 in turn recruits members of the IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family and TRAF6, leading to oligomerisation and selfubiquitination of TRAF6 [24]. TRIF also recruits TRAF6 [25] and RIP1 [26] via a direct interaction. Both pathways then activate TAK1 and IKK in a ubiquitination-dependent manner similar to the TNF pathway (Figure 1).\nThe noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway can be activated by the lymphotoxin beta receptor, BAFF receptor, CD40, and RANK (Figure 2). In this pathway, p100 is processed by the proteasome to p52, which together with the RelB NF-kappaB subunit regulates a distinct set of target genes that control B-cell development, secondary lymphoid organ development, and osteoclastogenesis [27] The noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway is strictly dependent on IKK1, which is activated upon phosphorylation by NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK). NIK is predominantly regulated at the post-translational level and is present at extremely low levels in most cell types. In unstimulated cells, NIK occurs in a cytoplasmic complex with TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1/2, which K48-polyubiquitinates NIK, leading to its continuous degradation by the proteasome. Receptor ligation has been shown not only to remove TRAF3 from this complex by recruiting it to the receptor, but also to attract TRAF2 and cIAP1/2, which are essential for subsequent TRAF3 degradation. All this contributes to releasing NIK from its constitutive degradation, resulting in NIK accumulation and IKK1 phosphorylation [28,29] (Figure 2).\nIt should be mentioned that CD40, lymphotoxin beta receptor and RANK mediate the activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB signalling pathways. Upon binding of their ligand, CD40 and RANK interact with several TRAF members, including TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6, and this leads to the proteolysis of both TRAF2 and TRAF3, which represents an important step in the activation of the noncanonical pathway as described above. Specific TRAF molecules are associated with overlapping and distinct CD40-mediated functions. For example, in B cells TRAF6 is required for CD40-mediated JNK activation and IL-6 production, while TRAF2 is required for activation of NF-kappaB, and TRAF3 serves as a negative regulator of CD40 signalling [30,31].",

        "inputsentence": "Since NF-kappaB activation is so crucial to many cellular processes, a tight regulation of the NF-kappaB signalling pathway and the genes it induces is an absolute requirement to fine-tune the inflammatory response. Moreover, terminating an NF-kappaB response is essential to prevent persistent NF-kappaB activation that may lead to chronic inflammation and/or tumorigenesis. To achieve this, cells employ different mechanisms, including the expression of inhibitory proteins that downregulate NF-kappaB signalling [32]. Below we give an overview of a number of proteins that are involved in the dampening or termination of the NF-kappaB response, some of them under the control of NF-kappaB itself and thus acting in a negative feedback loop. In addition, we discuss the potential role of these NF-kappaB inhibitory factors in the immunopathology of RA. Several other proteins involved in the negative regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory responses, such as MyD88s, IRAK-M, and TOLLIP, have been described (reviewed in [33]). These proteins are not discussed here, since a link with RA pathology has not yet been reported.Although IKK1 is a critical component of the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway, it should be mentioned that this kinase also plays a prominent role in the negative regulation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways. Macrophages from IKK1-deficient mice or knockin mice expressing inactive IKK1 show increased production of proinflammatory cytokines as a result of enhanced IKK2 activation and IkappaBalpha degradation [34]. IKK1 has also been shown to inhibit nuclear NF-kappaB and to downregulate proinflammatory signalling by phosphorylating STAT1 [35]. Interestingly, a recent study has demonstrated that IKK1 phosphorylates NIK in negative feedback regulation of the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway [36], supporting the idea that IKK1 plays important roles in terminating both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways with possible implications for chronic inflammatory diseases like RA.",

        "inputsentence": "A20 protein\nA20 (also known as TNFAIP3) is a ubiquitin-editing protein that negatively regulates NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in response to different immune-activating stimuli, including TNF, IL-1 and antigens, and the triggering of TLRs and the nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-containing 2 receptor (reviewed in [37]). A20 is believed to inhibit NF-kappaB function by deubiquitinating specific NF-kappaB signalling molecules, such as RIP1, RIP2, TRAF6 and MALT1, which disrupts specific protein-protein interactions [38-41] (Figure 1). Recently, the disruption of interactions between E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (Ubc13 and Ubc5hc) and E3 ubiquitin ligases (TRAF6, TRAF2 and cIAP1/2) were described as another important mechanism used by A20 to downregulate NF-kappaB signalling [42]. The association of A20 with its targets requires specific ubiquitin-binding adaptor proteins, including A20-binding inhibitor of NF-kappaB (ABIN) 1 and Tax1-binding protein 1 [43-46].\nNext to its role in suppressing NF-kappaB activation, A20 is also a strong inhibitor of apoptosis, at least in some cell types. The mechanisms by which A20 regulates apoptotic signalling, however, are still elusive. A20-deficient mice spontaneously develop multiorgan inflammation and cachexia and die within 2 weeks of birth, illustrating the potent anti-inflammatory function of this molecule [46]. A20-deficient cells are also more susceptible to TNF-mediated apoptosis, confirming its role as an antiapoptotic protein. We recently showed that mice specifically lacking A20 in intestinal epithelial cells exhibit increased susceptibility to experimental colitis due to the hypersensitivity of their intestinal epithelial cells to TNF-induced apoptosis, confirming A20 as a major antiapoptotic protein in the intestinal epithelium [47]. Two independent studies showed that mice lacking A20 in B cells develop autoimmunity due to hyperactive NF-kappaB responses in B cells leading to unrestricted B-cell survival [48,49].\nA20 expression has been observed in several cell types that play important roles in the pathophysiology of RA, such as fibroblasts, synoviocytes and lymphocytes. Interestingly, A20 expression is itself regulated by NF-kappaB [50], implicating A20 in the negative feedback regulation of NF-kappaB signalling. Recently, intra-articular injection of an A20-expressing adenovirus was shown to reduce the severity of synovial inflammation and joint destruction in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, even in untreated joints, in both a prophylactic and therapeutic setting. A20 expression in synovial tissue was associated with inhibition of NF-kappaB activity and decreased levels of TNF, IL-1beta, IL-6, soluble RANKL, monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1, and IL-17, suggesting that A20 induces a protective effect in collagen-induced arthritis mice through suppression of NF-kappaB activation and NF- kappaB-dependent gene expression [51]. Because TNF and IL-1beta are known to mediate synovitis, pannus formation, and erosion of cartilage and bone in RA, the decreased serum levels of TNF and IL-1beta in A20-transduced mice might explain the beneficial effects in the clinical, pathological, and radiological findings. This study also demonstrated that A20 overexpression leads to a decrease in the number of activated osteoclasts in joint tissue. A20 might therefore minimise joint destruction through decreasing the osteoclast number and activity. It will be interesting to analyse in future the susceptibility of conditional knockout mice that lack A20 in specific cell types such as synovial fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells or T cells.\nImportantly, several SNPs in the human A20 locus have been associated with increased susceptibility to development of autoimmune pathologies (reviewed in [52]). Several genome-wide association studies also revealed a clear association between mutations in the A20 locus in the 6q23 chromosome and susceptibility to RA [52]. Although the identified variants are not located in a gene, they are thought to influence A20 as its nearest gene (~150 kb downstream of A20), probably by the presence of potential regulatory DNA elements in this region. As A20 is required for termination of TNF-induced signals, and TNF is the primary inflammatory cytokine in RA, these findings reveal A20 as a candidate susceptibility locus for RA. How these variants affect normal A20 activity and how they cause RA, however, remain unclear. Recently, Elsby and colleagues functionally evaluated in vitro the regulatory ability of RA-associated SNP variants on A20 promoter activity, and could show repressed A20 transcription for some of the SNPs investigated [53]. It will be of interest to identify the actual causal variants and to elucidate the functional consequences of these variants. In this context, knockin mice for the corresponding A20 SNPs, combined with mouse models for RA, will be very valuable tools.",

Because ABINs contain a specific ubiquitin-binding motif, they have been proposed to target A20 to polyubiquitinated substrates [43,44]. Similar to A20, ABIN-1 and ABIN-3 expression is NF-kappaB dependent, implicating a potential role for the A20/ABIN complex in the negative feedback regulation of NF-kappaB activation (reviewed in [54]). Unexpectedly, both ABIN-1-deficient and ABIN-2-deficient mice exhibit only slightly increased or normal NF-kappaB responses, respectively, possibly reflecting redundant NF-kappaB inhibitory activities of multiple ABINs [55,56]. Functional ABIN-3 is expressed in humans, but mice only express a truncated and inactive form lacking the crucial ubiquitin-binding domain [57]. As for A20, ABIN-1 also strongly inhibits TNF-induced apoptosis [58], and ABIN-1 deficient mice die embryonically due to TNF-dependent foetal liver apoptosis [56].\nUsing oligonucleotide microarray analysis, ABIN-1 was identified among TNF-induced genes in human synoviocytes, and high levels of ABIN-1 mRNA were detected in RA tissue biopsies, indicating a potential role for ABIN-1, together with A20, in the negative feedback regulation of NF-kappaB signalling and the pathogenesis of RA [59]. In a recent study, inhibition of TLR responses by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors was shown to depend on the expression of the NF-kappaB inhibitory proteins ABIN-3 and A20. Moreover, this protective effect of the ITAM was strongly suppressed in inflammatory arthritis synovial macrophages [60]. Interestingly, ABIN-1 polymorphisms have been associated with psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus in humans [61,62]. A high degree of overlap between systemic lupus erythematosus and RA susceptibility loci might be expected as the two diseases show some clinical overlap in joint involvement, autoantibody production, systemic features and response to treatments such as B-cell depletion (rituximab). It will therefore be interesting to investigate whether SNPs that have been reported to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus are also associated with RA.",

CYLD is also involved, however, in diverse physiological processes ranging from immunity and inflammation to cell cycle progression, spermatogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis (reviewed in [64]). CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates NF-kappaB signalling initiated by TNFR, RANK and T-cell receptor stimulation (reviewed in [64]) (Figure 1), by deubiquitina-ting several NF-kappaB signalling proteins including NEMO, TRAF2, TRAF6, TRAF7, RIP1 and TAK1. Many of these are also targeted by A20 and it is still not clear why the cell needs A20 as well as CYLD to control NF-kappaB activation. As A20 is only expressed in many cell types upon stimulation, it has been suggested that this protein mainly regulates later phases of NF-kappaB signalling, whereas CYLD would regulate constitutive and early signalling. In addition, their relative activity might also be cell-type dependent [64].\nInterestingly, CYLD has been shown to negatively regulate RANK signalling and osteoclastogenesis in mice [65]. Mice with a genetic deficiency of CYLD have aberrant osteoclast differentiation and develop severe osteoporosis. Osteoclast precursors of these mice are hyper-responsive to RANKL-induced differentiation and produce more and larger osteoclasts. CYLD expression is markedly upregulated under conditions of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and is recruited to ubiquitinated TRAF6 via the ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein p62 (also known as sequestosome 1) [65], followed by the CYLD-mediated deubiquitination of TRAF6. In this context, it is worth mentioning that transgenic mice expressing a mutated form of p62 also display abnormal osteoclastogenesis and develop progressive bone loss [66]. These findings suggest that CYLD-mediated inhibi-tion of RANK-induced NF-kappaB signalling plays a key role in the negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis and indicate CYLD as a potential genetic factor involved in the pathology of bone disorders such as RA.",

Given the important role of IL-1R and TLR signalling in the chronic inflammation observed in RA [68], a regulatory role for SIGIRR in RA is not unlikely. SIGIRR has a very restricted expression pattern, being expressed in epithelial cells, monocytes and immature dendritic cells, but not in mature macro-phages [69,70]. Recently, SIGIRR overexpression was shown to inhibit the spontaneous release of inflammatory cytokines by human RA synovial cells. This inhibitory function of SIGIRR was further confirmed in vivo, since SIGIRR-deficient mice developed a more severe disease in zymosan-induced arthritis, as well as collagen-induced arthritis mouse models [70]. It will be interesting to compare the expression of SIGIRR in RA patients with its expression in control patients, or to investigate whether the function of SIGIRR is compromised in RA patients.

Accumulating data support a role for TRAF1 as both a negative and a positive modulator of NF-kappaB signalling by certain TNF family receptors, possibly in a cell-type-dependent manner [71,72]. Expression of TRAF1 is inducible by TNF and overexpression of TRAF1 inhibits TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation. TRAF1-deficient T cells are hyper-responsive to TNF, with enhanced proliferation and activation of the NF-kappaB signalling pathway. TRAF1 also functions as a negative regulator of CD40-induced NF-kappaB activation. TRAF1-deficient dendritic cells, however, show attenuated responses to secondary stimulation by TRAF2-dependent factors, suggesting a positive regulatory role in these cells. The mechanism by which TRAF1 modulates NF- kappaB activation is still unclear. Most probably, TRAF1 competes with TRAF family members for binding to the receptor or other signalling proteins. Alternatively, TRAF1 might recruit A20 with which it can physically interact [73]. A genome-wide association study examining more than 300,000 SNPs among approximately 1,500 autoantibody-positive RA cases and 1,800 controls identified a genetic variation at the TRAF1-complement component 5 locus as an important RA risk locus [74].

In addition, miR-146a is an NF-kappaB-dependent gene, and the NF-kappaB signalling molecules IRAK1 and TRAF6 were identified as target genes of miR-146a [78] (Figure 1). Similarly, miR-155 was shown to target transcripts for the NF-kappaB signalling molecules IKKepsilon and RIP1 [79,80]. Notably, both miR-146 and miR-155 are expressed at higher levels in RA synovial fibroblasts and synovial tissue [81,82], as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of RA patients [83]. miR-146a is also overexpressed in CD4+ and IL-17-producing T cells from RA patients [84,85]. Interestingly, a polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of the miR-146a target gene was recently shown to be associated with RA susceptibility [86]. miR-155 overexpression in synovial fibroblasts was able to prevent the TLR and cytokine-inducible expression of specific matrix metalloproteinases that mediate tissue destruction in RA [81]. Moreover, miR-155 was shown to promote TNF production, a key process in the pathogenesis of RA [87]. miR-146 and miR-155 may therefore be important negative regulators of inflammation in RA and their potential for the development of new treatments is substantial. In addition, their increased expression in RA patients is potentially useful as a marker for disease diagnosis, progression, or treatment efficacy [88], but this will require confirmation using a large and well-defined cohort.\nBesides miR-146 and miR-155, a number of other miRNAs with a potential role in the control of NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory responses in RA pathology were recently identified.

A20 deficient macrophages were hyperresponsive to double stranded RNA and IAV infection, as illustrated by enhanced NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation, concomitant with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferon. In vivo this was associated with an increased number of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of IAV infected mice. Surprisingly, myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice are protected against lethal IAV infection. These results challenge the general belief that an excessive host proinflammatory response is associated with IAV-induced lethality, and suggest that under certain conditions inhibition of A20 might be of interest in the management of IAV infections.",

        "inputsentence": "Viruses are a class of highly diverse pathogens which depend on the host cell for their replication. The initiation of a protective innate antiviral immune response involves the action of specialized pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which detect conserved molecular structures of the invading pathogen. Triggering of PRRs induces the production of host proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL-6 and IL-1) and type I interferons (interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-beta) through activation of downstream signaling pathways that control various transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, AP-1, IRF3 and IRF7 [1], [2]. The presence of viral nucleic acids, such as viral RNA and DNA, viral replication intermediates and viral transcription products, can be sensed by specific intracellular PRRs [3]. Endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic RNA helicase RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) or Nod-like receptors (NLRs) detect the presence of viral single stranded (TLR7, TLR8, Nod2) or double stranded RNA (TLR3, RIG-I, MDA5). Intracellular DNA sensors that mediate antiviral immune responses to DNA viruses include TLR9, DAI [4] and the PYHIN domain containing proteins AIM2 [5], [6], [7] and IFI16 [8]. TLR mediated antiviral responses are restricted to specialized type I IFN producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), while most other cell types, including conventional DC (cDC), macrophages and fibroblasts, depend on the cytosolic RNA and DNA sensors for the production of antiviral proteins [9].\nInfluenza A virus (IAV) is the etiological agent of a contagious acute respiratory disease that causes considerable mortality, which is generally believed to be due to an excessive host inflammatory response. Emergence of drug-resistant strains of influenza viruses with pandemic potential underscores the importance of developing novel antiviral strategies. In this context, understanding of the mechanisms that regulate IAV-induced immune responses is critical. IAV infection leads to the exposure in the host cell of single-stranded genomic RNA and double stranded RNA, the latter being an intermediate of viral replication. TLR3 and RIG-I have been implicated as sensors of IAV infection [10]-[12]. Both receptors contribute to the proinflammatory response to IAV, but the initiation of the innate antiviral immune response largely depends on RIG-I mediated signaling [13]. Interestingly, RIG-I deficient mice are highly susceptible to IAV [14], [15], whereas TLR3 deficient mice have a survival advantage to acute infection [16]. These results indicate that an imbalance between the beneficial and harmful effects of mediators released by immune cells is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza.\nRIG-I contains a C-terminal DExD/H box helicase domain, which is required for ligand recognition, and two N-terminal CARD domains. Upon ligand binding, the CARD domains of RIG-I associate with the CARD domain of the MAVS (also termed IPS-1, VISA, Cardif) adaptor protein, which subsequently translocates to and inserts in the outer mitochondrial membrane via its C-terminal transmembrane domain [17]-[20]. Signaling downstream of MAVS requires the action of various ubiquitin modifying enzymes, which both positively and negatively regulate RIG-I mediated signal transduction [21]. K63-specific ubiquitin ligases (E3s), such as TRIM25 [22] and Riplet [23], [24], have been shown to directly promote RIG-I activation. In addition, well characterized ubiquitin ligases such as TRAF6 [25], [26] and TRAF3 [27] mediate respectively NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation upon RIG-I stimulation. On the other hand, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), such as DUBA [28], CYLD [29], [30] and OTUB1/2 [31] have been shown to negatively regulate RLR signaling by specifically removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from several signaling molecules. Furthermore, various K48-specific ubiquitin ligases, such as AIP4 [32] and TRIAD3A [33] mark respectively MAVS and TRAF3 for proteasome mediated degradation, thus inhibiting further downstream signaling. Additionally, the attachment of K48-specific polyubiquitin chains to the IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors by E3s such as RAUL [34], TRIM21 [35] and RBCK1 [36] further dampens antiviral signal transduction.\nA20 is an ubiquitin-editing enzyme belonging to the OTU-domain family of DUBs. Interestingly, A20 also harbors atypical zinc finger dependent K48-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Both catalytic and noncatalytic mechanisms were previously shown to be involved in the negative regulation of proinflammatory signaling by A20 in response to multiple receptors such as TNF receptor I [37]-[39], TLR4 [40], and IL-1R [41]. The anti-inflammatory role of A20 is clearly demonstrated by the fact that A20 deficient mice die early after birth due to severe multi-organ inflammation and cachexia [37]. More recently, gene targeting of A20 in specific cell types was shown to be associated with autoimmunity and chronic inflammation [42]-[48], further illustrating that A20 is an important brake on the inflammatory response. The relevance of these findings for human disease has recently been illustrated through the identification of polymorphisms in the A20 locus that are associated with several autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammation [45]. In contrast to its well established function in the regulation of proinflammatory responses, the role of A20 in the regulation of antiviral immune responses is less well described and limited to a number of in vitro studies using overexpression or silencing in specific cell lines, indicating that A20 may regulate RIG-I- and TLR3-induced signaling to NF-kappaB and IRF-3 [49]-[52]. However, the precise in vivo role of A20 in the response to viral infection remains to be clarified. Using myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice (A20myel-KO) that were recently generated in our lab and primary cells derived of these mice, we here provide evidence that A20 is a crucial negative regulator of IAV-induced proinflammatory and antiviral signaling in macrophages. Interestingly, A20myel-KO mice show enhanced survival and reduced morbidity in response to IAV lung infection compared to wild type mice. Protection against IAV in A20myel-KO mice is associated with increased cytokine and chemokine production, augmented recruitment of innate immune cells such as neutophils and alveolar macrophages, and enhanced viral clearance. These results suggest that boosting the innate immune response to IAV by targeting A20 activity in myeloid cells might have therapeutic potential.",

        "inputsentence": "A20 inhibits RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation\nRIG-I signaling induces the activation of NF-kappaB, IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors, which promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs that restrict further viral propagation. Previous studies have shown that ectopically expressed A20 negatively regulates NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation upon RIG-I stimulation [50]-[52]. Similarly, we show that A20 overexpression in HEK293T cells prevents NF-kappaB- and IRF3-dependent luciferase reporter gene activation induced by transfection of a truncated constitutive active form of RIG-I [53], corresponding to only the two N-terminal CARD domains of RIG-I [RIG-I (2CARD)] (figure 1A, left and middle graph). We next investigated whether A20 also inhibits IRF7 activation. Unlike IRF3, IRF7 is not or weakly expressed under naive conditions and IRF7 protein levels are rapidly upregulated upon virus-induced IRF3 activation [54], [55]. To determine the effect of A20 on IRF7 activation, we therefore transfected minor amounts of an IRF7 expression plasmid together with plasmids encoding RIG-I (2CARD), A20 and an IRF7-specific IFNalpha4 luciferase reporter construct. RIG-I (2CARD) expression in the absence of IRF7 co-expression showed negligible IFNalpha4 promoter activation (grey bar, figure 1A, right graph), whereas significant reporter gene expression was observed in the presence of IRF7. Similar to its inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation, A20 also prevented RIG-I-induced IRF7 activation (figure 1A, right graph). These results demonstrate the potential of A20 to inhibit RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3/7 activation.\nTo study the effect of endogenously expressed A20 on RIG-I-induced signaling in a more immunological relevant context, we performed further experiments in A20 deficient primary macrophages. Since A20 full knockout mice die prematurely as a result of severe multi-organ inflammation [37], we generated mice carrying a conditional A20 allele in which exon IV and exon V were flanked by two loxP sites [56]. Crossing these mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the lysozyme M promoter leads to specific deletion in myeloid cells and allowed us to generate myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice [48]. To stimulate the RIG-I receptor, we transfected A20myel-KO BMDM and wild type control cells with minimal amounts of low molecular weight (LMW) poly(I:C), which is known to preferentially bind and activate RIG-I rather than MDA5 [57]. Of note, this concentration of poly(I:C) was unable to induce significant TLR3 dependent NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation or cytokine production (data not shown). As expected, poly(I:C) transfection induced the rapid expression of A20 in wild type, but not in A20myel-KO BMDM (figure 1B, upper panel). At early time points, slightly slower migrating forms of A20 were observed, indicating that A20 undergoes a yet unknown modification upon poly(I:C) transfection. Compared to wild type BMBM, A20 deficient cells showed enhanced NF-kappaB activation as indicated by increased phosphorylation and sustained degradation of IkappaBalpha (figure 1B). Furthermore, nuclear translocation of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit was enhanced in poly(I:C) transfected A20myel-KO BMDM, reaching a maximum at earlier time points compared to wild type cells (figure 1C). IRF3 is known to be activated upon phosphorylation of a series of carboxyl terminal serine residues by the IKK-like kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon [58], leading to its dimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus [59]. Using immunoblotting with an antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser396, maximum IRF3 phosphorylation was detected at earlier time points in A20myel-KO BMDM compared to wild type BMDM (figure 1B). Similar to p65, IRF3 nuclear translocation reached its maximum at an earlier time point in A20 deficient BMDM compared to wild type cells (figure 1C). NF-kappaB controls the expression of IL-6 and TNF, and NF-kappaB and IRF3 control the expression of IFNbeta. In line with the enhanced activation of NF-kappaB and IRF3 as described above, A20myel-KO BMDM secreted increased amounts of IL-6, TNF and IFNbeta (figure 1D). Similar results were obtained using peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that A20 plays an important role in the negative regulation of RIG-I-induced NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation in primary macrophages.",

A20 mRNA levels were rapidly induced in wild type BMDM, but not in A20 deficient BMDM, upon viral infection (figure 2A). Furthermore, A20myel-KO BMDM show enhanced expression of IL-6 and IFNbeta mRNA after IAV infection compared to control cells (figure 2A). In accordance with these data, cell culture supernatant collected from these cells contained higher levels of TNF and IFNbeta (figure 2B).\nUpon host infection with IAV, alveolar macrophages are an important source of cytokines and chemokines, attracting innate immune cells to the lung during the primary phase of infection. To test whether A20 directly controls IAV-induced gene expression in alveolar macrophages, we isolated these cells from lungs of A20myel-KO and control littermates and infected them in vitro with IAV X-47. Expression and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF, the type-I IFN IFNbeta and IFNalpha4 and the chemokines MCP-1 (ccl2) and KC (cxcl1) was significantly higher in IAV infected cells lacking A20 compared to infected wild type cells (figure 2C and figure S1).

        "inputsentence": "A20 deficiency in myeloid cells protects against IAV lung infection\nTo determine the role of A20 expression in myeloid cells during an IAV infection in vivo, we intranasally inoculated both A20myel-KO mice and control littermates with a sublethal dose of the mouse adapted IAV X-47 (H3N2) strain and monitored morbidity in terms of weight loss. A20myel-KO mice showed reduced weight loss compared to wild type control littermates and recovered faster from the viral challenge (figure 3A). Also, total protein concentration in BAL fluid, which reflects lung damage and vascular leakage, was increased significantly at 7 and 10 days post infection in both wild type and A20myel-KO mice, and was slightly lower in A20myel-KO mice (data not shown). Next, we measured pulmonary viral titers at 4, 7 and 10 days post infection. No differences in viral titers were observed in A20myel-KO mice versus wild type mice at day 4 and 7 post infection. However, after 10 days, almost no virus could be detected in the lungs of A20myel-KO mice while abundant infectious viral particles could still be isolated from lungs of all wild type mice (figure 3B). This indicates that loss of A20 in myeloid cells does not affect early viral replication but contributes to viral clearance at later stages during infection.\nTo verify if A20 deficiency in myeloid cells affects IAV-induced gene expression in the lung, we analyzed the levels of several chemokines and cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at day 4, 7 and day 10 following infection. Levels of KC and MIP-2 chemokines, as well as IL-6 were significantly higher at day 7 p.i. in BAL from IAV infected A20myel-KO mice compared to IAV infected wild type mice (figure 3C). Unlike our observations with in vitro stimulated primary macrophages we could not detect a significant increase in MCP-1 or IFNalpha production in the lungs of A20myel-KO animals (figure 3C). KC is the murine orthologue of IL-8 and serves together with MIP-2 as a chemoattractant for neutrophils, while MCP-1 is mainly known as a chemoattractant for monocytes, which eventually develop into macrophages upon entering the alveolar lumen [60]. Consistent with the higher KC and MIP-2 levels in A20myel-KO mice, the number of neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6C+ Ly6G+ F4/80-) that were recruited in the bronchoalveolar spaces upon IAV infection was clearly higher throughout infection in A20myel-KO mice compared to control animals (figure 3D). Although we could detect a significant increase in monocyte (CD11b+ Ly6C+) recruitment at day 4 post infection, this was not evident at later time points after infection (figure 3D), which is consistent with the equal expression of MCP-1 in both groups of mice. The number of resident alveolar macrophages (autofluorescent+ CD11c+ F4/80+ CD11b-) was also elevated in A20myel-KO mice but did not differ significantly between IAV infected or mock infected mice (figure 3D). Elimination of IAV infected cells depends on the clonal expansion of virus specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTL) [61], [62], [63]. To test whether A20 expression in myeloid cells regulates the antiviral CTL response, total CD8+ T cells and virus specific Granzyme B (GrB) and IFNgamma expressing CD8+ T cells were measured in BAL and lung parenchyma of wild type and A20myel-KO mice. A clear increase in CD8+ T cells could be detected at day 7 and 10 post infection, but no differences were observed between A20myel-KO and wild type mice (figure S2A and figure S2C). Also, the number of GrB and IFNgamma CD8+ T cells as well as IFNgamma expression levels in the lungs were not altered by the absence of A20 in myeloid cells (figure S2A-C).\nProtection against IAV infection is also provided by the humoral immune response. To test whether loss of A20 in myeloid cells affects B cell mediated immunity, we determined hemagglutinin (HA) antibody titers in the serum of A20myel-KO and wild type littermates. However, no differences could be detected between wild type and A20myel-KO animals (figure S2D), indicating that humoral immunity is not affected by A20 expression in myeloid cells. Together, these data suggest that mechanisms other than adaptive immunity, such as an increased innate immune response, characterized by an increased influx of neutrophils and increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, contribute to the better viral clearance in A20myel-KO mice.\nIt is generally believed that IAV-induced mortality is due to an excessive proinflammatory response in the lung. We therefore analyzed whether the increased proinflammatory cytokine production and infiltration of proinflammatory cells in A20myel-KO mice affects mortality induced by intranasal infection with a lethal dose of IAV X-47. Surprisingly, almost all A20myel-KO mice survived (10/11), while all control mice succumbed (0/11) within 16 days after infection (figure 4A). A20myel-KO mice still showed significant weight loss and lung damage (as reflected by increased total protein concentration in the BAL; data not shown) during the course of infection but were able to recover, in contrast to wild type mice that succumbed (figure 4B). Similar to our observations with sublethal IAV infection, pulmonary KC and MIP-2 production was stronger in A20myel-KO animals compared to wild type mice following lethal IAV infection (figure 4C), which correlates with the increased numbers of neutrophils in the lungs of these mice (figure 4C). Also levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF and IL-1beta, which are often associated with immunopathogenesis in humans [64], were increased in the lungs of A20myel-KO mice compared to control animals (figure 4C and figure S3A). Again, MCP-1 production was not increased and even lower in A20myel-KO mice (figure 4C), and also monocyte recruitment was not different between both groups of mice. We could also not detect any differences in viral clearance or antiviral adaptive immunity at 6 h post infection (figure S3B-F). Collectively these data indicate that A20 deficiency in myeloid cells is associated with an increased innate immune response and protection against a lethal IAV infection.",

        "inputsentence": "In the present study we have investigated the contribution of A20 expression in myeloid cells in the innate immune response to IAV lung infection. In the pulmonary environment, macrophages populate both lung parenchyma and the alveolar lumen where they are referred to as alveolar macrophages. Under naive conditions, alveolar macrophages exert important immunomodulatory functions [65], [66]. However, alveolar macrophages are also crucial in the innate immune response against IAV as they are one of the first cells that encounter infectious IAV particles [67], [68]. They are an important source of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that attract innate immune cells to the lung during the primary phase of infection [69], and they are the primary producers of type I IFNs [70]. Alveolar macrophages are also known to phagocytose virus infected apoptotic cells and antibody coated viral particles, further contributing to viral clearance. We could show that BMDM or alveolar macrophages derived from A20myel-KO mice express higher amounts of chemokines, cytokines and type I IFNs compared to wild type mice in response to in vitro infection. Similarly, in vivo infection with IAV resulted in higher levels of primarily neutrophil attracting chemokines such as KC and MIP-2 and several proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF and IL-1beta in the lungs of A20myel-KO mice compared to wild type mice. This was associated with a selective enhancement of neutrophil recruitment to the bronchoalveolar compartment, and resulted in improved viral clearance later on during infection. Although the role of neutrophils during viral infection is still under debate, recent evidence supports a protective function of these cells during IAV infection [71], [72]. MCP-1 levels were not affected by the absence of A20 in myeloid cells, which is consistent with the notion that airway epithelial cells are the primary source of MCP-1 production during IAV infection [73]. Mice deficient for the MCP-1 receptor CCR2, which is expressed on a subset of circulating monocytes, are protected against IAV infection and display reduced signs of immunopathology [74]-[76]. During IAV infection these monocytes develop into inflammatory dendritic cells or proinflammatory macrophages [77] and are considered major contributors to IAV-induced immunopathology [78]. A20myel-KO mice were protected against a lethal IAV infection, which is rather surprising since an excessive proinflammatory cytokine response and an excessive influx of inflammatory cells is generally believed to be associated with increased lethality [64], [79]. However, the selective effect of A20 deficiency on neutrophil recruitment, without altering inflammatory monocyte (Ly6C+ CD11b+) recruitment, further support the idea that monocytes and not neutrophils are major contributors to IAV-associated immunopathology and lethality [78].\nWe show that A20 deficient BMDM display enhanced NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation in response to RIG-I stimulation by synthetic LMW double stranded RNA. RIG-I has previously been shown to play a key role in the innate immune response to IAV [13], suggesting that the increased immune response of A20myel-KO mice to IAV lung infection reflects enhanced RIG-I signaling. We propose that A20 inhibits IAV-induced proinflammatory gene expression (as shown in our manuscript for TNF, IL-6, KC, MIP-2, and IFNbeta) by negatively regulating NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation, which are the major pathways controlling these genes. However, this does not exclude an additional effect of A20 on other signaling pathways that may contribute to proinflammatory gene expression. A20 is believed to exert its NF-kappaB and IRF3 inhibitory functions by modulating the ubiquitination status of different signaling proteins [80]. In this context, it was recently shown that A20 cooperates with the ubiquitin-binding proteins TAX1BP1 and ABIN1 to to disrupt the TRAF3-TBK1-IKKepsilon complex, thereby negatively affecting K63-polyubiquitination of TBK1 and IKKepsilon, and their ability to activity IRF3 [81], [82]. Whether similar mechanisms are involved in the regulation of RIG-I induced NF-kappaB activation is still unclear. So far we were unable to clearly detect ubiquitination of TBK1 and IKKepsilon in primary macrophages, preventing us from studying the effect of A20 deficiency on their ubiquitination status. It cannot be excluded however that A20 also targets other substrates that mediate NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation in myeloid cells. The identification of these substrates will be the topic of future investigations in our laboratory. Multiple other deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), such as DUBA [28], CYLD [29], [30], OTUB1/2 [31], and A20 [49]-[52] have been shown to negatively regulate RIG-I signaling to NF-kappaB and IRF-3, implicating possible redundancy. However, evidence so far was limited to in vitro data and was obtained under non-physiological conditions. The clear protective phenotype of A20myel-KO mice that we here describe indicates that A20 expression in myeloid cells is a central gatekeeper of RIG-I induced signaling in response to IAV infection and that other DUBs cannot substitute for A20 deficiency under physiological conditions. If A20 has a similar non-redundant role in other cell types that are implicated in the response to IAV, such as lung epithelial cells, remains to be investigated.\nUnderstanding and controlling the activation of innate antiviral immune responses is an important step toward novel therapies. About a fifth of world's population is infected by IAV annually, leading to high morbidity and mortality, particularly in infants, the elderly and the immunocompromised. The high mutation rate of IAV turns all attempts of vaccine and antiviral design into a never ending battle. In recent years, RNA interference, triggered by synthetic short interfering RNA (siRNA), has rapidly evolved as a potent antiviral regimen. Properly designed siRNAs have been shown to function as potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication. Although specificity and tissue delivery remain major bottlenecks in the clinical applications of RNAi in general, intranasal application of siRNA against respiratory viruses including, but not limited to influenza virus, has experienced significant success and optimism [83]. Our results suggest that not only siRNA targeting IAV components, but boosting the antiviral immune response by intranasal administration of siRNA against A20 might be a valid therapeutic approach. Also small compound inhibitors of A20 might be an interesting alternative. Finally, similar targeting of A20 might be of interest in the battle against other viral infections including RSV and SARS coronavirus.",

To elucidate the mechanism of SE-induced vasogenic edema, we investigated the roles of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption during vasogenic edema and its related events in rat epilepsy models provoked by pilocarpine-induced SE.\nMethods\nSE was induced by pilocarpine in rats that were intracerebroventricularly infused with saline-, and soluble TNF p55 receptor (sTNFp55R) prior to SE induction. Thereafter, we performed Fluoro-Jade B staining and immunohistochemical studies for TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB subunits.\nResults\nFollowing SE, most activated microglia showed strong TNF-alpha immunoreactivity. In addition, TNF p75 receptor expression was detected in endothelial cells as well as astrocytes. In addition, only p65-Thr435 phosphorylation was increased in endothelial cells accompanied by SMI-71 expression (an endothelial barrier antigen). Neutralization of TNF-alpha by soluble TNF p55 receptor (sTNFp55R) infusion attenuated SE-induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damages via inhibition of p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Furthermore, sTNFp55R infusion reduced SE-induced neutrophil infiltration in the PC.\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest that impairments of endothelial cell functions via TNF-alpha-mediated p65-Thr 485 NF-kappaB phosphorylation may be involved in SE-induced vasogenic edema.

        "inputsentence": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency with significant mortality [1]. SE has been defined as continuous seizure activity, which causes neuronal cell death, epileptogenesis and learning impairment [2,3]. Some brain regions vulnerable to SE play a role in the generation and propagation of paroxysmal activity in experimental epilepsy models. The piriform cortex (PC) is one of the most susceptible brain regions to seizure-induced damage in the kainate, pilocarpine and other models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) [4-6]. Pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist, induces SE in rodents. This pilocarpine-induced SE, similar to human TLE, shows massive neuronal loss in the hippocampus followed by glial proliferation. This neuronal damage in the pilocarpine model is not restricted to the hippocampus, but often extends to extrahippocampal limbic structures. Indeed, pilocarpine-induced SE results in acute neuronal damages within layers II and III of the PC [5,6].\nSE also induces severe vasogenic edema in the PC accompanied by neuronal and astroglial damages [5-8]. Brain edema proceeds in two phases, early cytotoxic edema phase and late vasogenic edema phase. Early cytotoxic osmotic edema is due to excess stimulation of glutamatergic pathways during SE, which increases intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations. The vasogenic edema results from dysfunction of endothelial cells and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Many studies have reported increased permeability of the BBB during epileptic activity [9-13]. A fast and significant increase in systemic blood pressure, particularly shown during tonic epileptic seizures, induces a marked vasodilation of the large cerebral arteries and an increase in blood pressure in capillaries, small arteries, and veins leading to leakage of the BBB [9]. Loss of BBB integrity is not only due to an abrupt increase in the intraluminal pressure but also influenced by the properties of cerebral tissue. Indeed, an acute increase in blood pressure or epileptic activity causes an increase in pinocytosis at the level of the cerebral endothelium [11-13].\nRecently, reports have also emphasized that seizure or epilepsy is a prolonged inflammatory condition, and that seizure activity rapidly increases the synthesis and release of various interleukins in rodent brain areas involved in seizure onset and their generalization. Cytokines act on endothelial cells and change the permeability of the BBB, which exerts significant effects on neuronal viability and excitability [14,15]. Indeed, Sztriha [16] reported that dexamethasone pretreatment reduces vasogenic edema in thalamus following kainic acid-induced seizure. Among cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a 17 kDa protein that is produced mainly by activated macrophages and T cells in the immune system. TNF-alpha is expressed at low levels in normal brain and is rapidly upregulated in glia, neurons and endothelial cells in various pathophysiological conditions, including SE [17,18]. TNF-alpha shows various effects on brain function depending on its local tissue concentration, the type of target cells, and especially the specific receptor subtype: TNF receptor I, or p55 receptor (TNFp55R); and TNF receptor II, or p75 receptor (TNFp75R) [19]. Furthermore, TNF-alpha induces macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) that recruits neutrophils under pathological conditions, including SE [14,20]. Neurons, microglia, and astrocytes produce MIP-2 when incubated with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and/or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) or after injury [21-23]. Indeed, we have recently reported that SE-mediated MIP-2 expression is relevant to leukocyte infiltrations following SE in an IL-1beta-independent manner [20]. However, the relationship between the TNF-alpha system and BBB disruption/neutrophil infiltration during vasogenic edema formation induced by epileptogenic insults has not been fully clarified. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the roles of TNF-alpha in vasogenic edema and its related events in rat epilepsy models provoked by pilocarpine-induced SE.",

Animals received 0.5 mul/hr of vehicle or compound for 1 week. Therefore, the dose of sTNFp55R was 0.6 mug/day per each animal. The compounds began to be immediately infused after surgery.

The subfield areas were delineated with a 2.5 x objective lens [5,7,8,18,25]. The volumes are reported as mm3. An optical fractionator was used to estimate cell numbers. The optical fractionator (a combination of performing counting with the optical dissector, with fractionator sampling) is a stereological method based on a properly designed systematic random sampling method that by definition yields unbiased estimates of population number. The sampling procedure is accomplished by focusing through the depth of the tissue (the optical dissector height, h; 15 mum in all cases for this study). The number of each cell type (C) in each of the subregions is estimated as: C = sigmaQ- x t/h x 1/asf x 1/ssf, where Q- is the number of cells actually counted in the dissectors that fell within the sectional profiles of the subregion seen on the sampled sections, and Asf is the areal sampling fraction calculated by the area of the counting frame of the dissector, a(frame) (of 50 x 50 mum2 in this study) and the area associated with each x, y movement, grid (x, y step) (of 250 x 250 mum2 in this study) {asf = (a(frame)/a(x, y step))}.

SE-induced PC atrophy is evident [8], so changes in cell number may be caused by an alterations in the volume of the PC.

        "inputsentence": "MIP-2 expression\nMIP-2 is a powerful chemokine that contributes to recruitment of neutrophils [27]. MIP-2 is undetectable or present at low levels under physiological conditions, and shows transient increases under pathological conditions via TNF-alpha and/or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-dependent mechanisms [14]. Thus, it would be plausible that TNF-alpha-mediated MIP-2 expression may provoke SE-induced neutrophil infiltrations. To confirm this hypothesis, we investigated MIP-2 expression in the PC. Consistent with our previous study [20], some MIP-2-positive astrocytes were observed in the core and periphery of the vasogenic edema lesions, but not in the non-vasogenic edema region (Figure 6B and 6C). Although the number of MIP-2 positive cells per unit area in the PC region of sTNFp55R-infused animals was significantly lower than that of the saline-infused group due to reduction of the area of vasogenic edema, there was no difference in the number of MIP-2 positive cells per unit area of vasogenic edema between sTNFp55R-infused animals and saline-infused animals (Figure 6F). Furthermore, the number of MIP-2-positive cells showed a direct proportion to the unit area of vasogenic edema with a linear coefficient of correlation of 0.682 (p < 0.05, Figure 6G). Therefore, together with reduction in neutrophil infiltration in the PC region of sTNFp55R-infused animals, our findings provide evidence that TNF-alpha may regulate SE-induced neutrophil infiltration at least in the PC via vasogenic edema formation and not via direct TNF-alpha-mediated MIP-2 expression in astrocytes.",

        "inputsentence": "The major findings in the present study are that TNF-alpha signaling showed cellular specific responses of NF-kappaB phosphorylation in the PC following SE, which may be related to vasogenic edema formation followed by neutrophil infiltration. BBB disruption has been reported in experimental and human epilepsy [12,13,15,16,28]. Leakage of serum-derived components into the extracellular space is associated with hyperexcitability and seizure onset [12,13,15,16,28]. Furthermore, dysfunction of the BBB leads to epileptogenesis and contributes to progression of epilepsy [12,13,15,16,28]. In the present study, TNF-alpha immunoreactivity was obviously observed in microglia in the PC following SE. TNF receptor expressions were also up-regulated in astrocytes (TNFp55R and TNFp75R) and endothelial cells (TNFp75R). Furthermore, blockade of TNF-alpha signaling by sTNFp55 infusion effectively (but not completely) reduced volumes of SE-induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damage in the PC. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha may participate in astroglial and endothelial responses to SE, which are relevant to SE-induced vasogenic edema formation [5-8]. Indeed, TNF-alpha signaling increases BBB permeability in various experimental disease models [29]. In the present study, sTNFp55 infusion could not completely prevent SE-induced vasogenic edema and neuronal damage in the PC. Therefore, our findings suggest that TNF-alpha signaling may not be a unique upstream event in vasogenic edema development.\np65 phosphorylation of NF-kappaB enhances its transactivation potential, and p65 phosphorylation occurs in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus [30]. In the present study, p65-Thr435 immunoreactivity was detected in endothelial cells, and its immunoreactivity showed an inverse correlation to the degree of SMI-71 expression. SMI-71, an endothelial barrier antigen, is a protein expressed by endothelial cells of rat BBB [31]. Under pathological conditions, SMI-71 expression is lost in endothelial cells [5,7,8,30,32]. Acute phases of the above pathological conditions are accompanied by opening of the BBB and development of vasogenic edema [33]. Indeed, neutralization of SMI-71 in vivo leads to widening of intercellular junctions between endothelial cells and swelling of perivascular astrocytic processes [34], although SMI-71 is not localized at endothelial cell junctions [35-38]. In the present study, SMI-71 immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in blood vessels 1 day after SE when vasogenic edema and neuronal damage were observed. Furthermore, sTNFp55R infusion effectively prevented SE-induced SMI-71 down-regulation. With respect to the phosphorylation of p65-Thr435 by TNF-alpha [39], our findings indicate that TNF-alpha-mediated p65-Thr435 phosphorylation in endothelial cells may play an important role in vasogenic edema induction via SMI-71 degradation or its posttranslational dysfunction influencing BBB permeability.\nIn our previous studies [5,8], dystrophin (an actin-binding protein [40]) immunoreactivity was detected in blood vessels and in astrocytic perivascular end-feet, and was down-regulated 12 hrs after SE prior to the appearance of vasogenic edema and down-regulation of SMI-71 immunoreactivity. With respect to this previous report, changes in SMI immunoreactivity would be causes/results of interaction between endothelial cells and perivascular astrocytes. In the present study, p65-Ser276, p65-Ser311, p65-Ser529, and p65-Ser536 phosphorylation was observed in astrocytes following SE. Furthermore, sTNFp55R infusion effectively inhibited p65-Ser276 and p65-Ser311phosphorylation in astrocytes following SE. Therefore, it is likely that enhanced p65-Ser276 and p65-Ser311 phosphorylation may be involved in TNF-alpha-mediated BBB disruption. However, sTNFp55R infusion could not prevent p65-Ser529 and p65-Ser536 phosphorylations from SE insults. Since p65-Ser529 and p65-Ser536 are phosphorylated by TNF-alpha and IL-1beta [41], it is likely that IL-1beta-mediated p65-Ser529/Ser536 phosphorylation may also play a role in SE-induced vasogenic edema. Therefore, our findings indicate that both TNF-alpha and IL-1beta may be synergists to play either a direct (by endothelial cells) or indirect (by astrocytes) role in the maintenance of BBB permeability.\nNeutrophil infiltration into brain parenchyma is transiently observed during the acute phase of SE (4 - 36 hr after SE) and disappears thereafter [20]. SE rapidly increases synthesis and release of chemokines in various areas of the rodent brain [42]. Among them, MIP-2 is required for efficient neutrophil or lymphocyte recruitment to brain parenchyma [43]. In our previous study [20], neutrophil infiltration in the frontoparietal cortex was regulated by P2X7 receptor-mediated MIP-2 expression. In the PC, however, neither a P2X7 receptor agonist/antagonist nor IL-1Ra (an IL-1beta antagonist) infusion could not affect leukocyte infiltration. In the present study, sTNFp55R infusion effectively inhibited neutrophil infiltration in the PC by reducing vasogenic edema formation in a MIP-2-independent manner. With respect to the present and our previous reports, it is therefore likely that vasogenic edema induced by TNF-alpha can induce neutrophil infiltration and press injury to evoke neuronal-astroglial loss in the PC, unlike other brain regions.\nIn conclusion, our findings reveal that impairments of endothelial cell function via TNF-alpha mediated p65-Thr 435 NF-kappaB phosphorylation may be involved in SE-induced vasogenic edema, which is relevant to neutrophil infiltration and neuronal-astroglial loss.",

Hence, we used primary cultured astrocytes from either Nrf2 wildtype or knockout mice to study the influence of Nrf2 on the activation of NF-kappaB and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in a model of TBI in vitro. Primary cultured astrocytes were scratched to mimic the traumatic injury in vitro. Then the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB was evaluated by EMSA. The mRNA and protein levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and MMP9 were also evaluated. Gelatin zymography was performed to detect the activity of MMP9. The activity of NF-kappaB and expression of proinflammatory cytokines mentioned above were upregulated at 24 h after scratch. The expression and activity of MMP9 were also elevated. And such tendency was much more prominent in Nrf2 KO astrocytes than that in WT astrocytes. These results suggest that the absence of Nrf2 may induce more aggressive inflammation through activation of NF-kappaB and downstream proinflammatory cytokines in astrocytes.",

        "inputsentence": "Brain damage following traumatic injury is a result of direct (primary injury) and indirect (secondary or delayed injury) mechanisms. The secondary injury mechanism involves the initiation of an acute inflammatory response, including breakdown of blood-brain barrier (BBB), brain edema, infiltration of peripheral blood cells, and activation of resident immunocompetent cells, as well as the release of numerous immune mediators such as interleukins and chemotactic factors [1]. And the subsequent inflammation leads to secondary damage not only in brain but also in other organs [2-4].\nNuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that regulates many kinds of antioxidant genes. Several studies have demonstrated that Nrf2 regulates the inflammation in the brain after traumatic brain injury (TBI). It was also showed that TBI could induce more aggravated damage in Nrf2 knockout mice than in wildtype mice [5]. On the contrary, such inflammation can be extenuated through elevating the level of Nrf2 by its inducers, such as sulforaphane (SFN) [6]. It is well documented that astrocytes play a critical role in maintaining normal brain physiology and responding to injury or disease. In fact, all the aforementioned studies are performed in vivo. Little is known about the relationship between Nrf2 and inflammation in astrocytes after TBI. Therefore, here we analysed the influence of Nrf2 on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in primary cultured astrocytes from transgenic mice after scratch injury.",

        "inputsentence": "The present study demonstrated that scratch injury induced the upregulation of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and overexpression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and MMP9 in cultured astrocytes. Also we revealed that scratch injury induced higher activity of NF-kappaB and enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines in Nrf2 knockout cultured astrocytes than those in wildtype astrocytes for the first time.\nIt has been demonstrated that NF-kappaB is activated in brain and spinal cord after traumatic injury [2, 9]. As a transcript factor, NF-kappaB binds with DNA once it was activated and induces transcription of MMP9 and a battery of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6, in brain tissues after TBI [3, 10, 11]. Our results also revealed that scratch injury induced elevation of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, overexpression of MMP9, and proinflammatory mediators mentioned above in cultured astrocytes. It has been demonstrated that there is an autoregulatory loop among these proinflammatory mediators. For example, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are potent stimulators for MMP9 in astrocytes [12, 13], and IL-6 induces overexpression of MMP9 in human colon carcinoma cells [14], and TNF-alpha and IL-1beta also can induce activation of NF-kappaB [15, 16]. This autoregulatory loop extremely aggravates the damaging effect of inflammation and induces secondary injury to brain. It is a good choice for targeting on an upstream factor to prevent such autoregulatory loop after TBI.\nNrf2-ARE pathway has been proved to be the key regulator in reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory damage, and accumulation of toxic metabolites, which are all involved in TBI. Our previous study has proved the augmentation of Nrf2 in brain tissue after TBI [17]. Enhanced level of Nrf2 activates transcription of a group of antioxidant genes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD (P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), which would subsequently reduce the damage in brain [18]. Postinjury administration of SFN, an inducer of Nrf2, significantly improves spatial memory of rat and decreases the immunoreactivity for 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a marker of lipid peroxidation, in the cortex and the CA3 subfield of hippocampus after TBI [19]. On the other hand, Nrf2-deficient mice appear more susceptible to TBI. Depletion of Nrf2 induces higher expression of proinflammatory mediators in brain after TBI [20]. Here, our results revealed that overexpression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and MMP9 after scratch injury was more aggravated in cultured Nrf2 knockout astrocytes than in wildtype astrocyetes for the first time, and overexpression of these proinflammatory mediators led to more astrocytes deaths.\nData obtained from animal studies suggest the possibility that antioxidant effect of Nrf2 may be achieved by suppression of proinflammatory pathways which are mediated by NF-kappaB signaling. Administration of SFN is found to be able to inhibit IKK/IkappaB phosphorylation and p65 NF-kappaB subunit nuclear translocation, consequently alleviating NF-kappaB signaling [21]. And NF-kappaB activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could be attenuated by diverse Nrf2 activators, such as SFN and curcumin (CUR) [22]. Furthermore, our previous studies indicate that depletion of Nrf2 induces augmentation of NF-kappaB activity and inflammatory response in lung, brain, and intestine after TBI [4, 5, 23]. Results from this study further confirmed such relationship existed in cultured astrocytes after scratch injury. Enhanced activation of NF-kappaB is also discovered in lung, macrophages, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts of Nrf2-deficient mice after experimental sepsis [24]. Interestingly, it is reported that NF-kappaB can inhibit Nrf2 at transcriptional level. NF-kappaB p65 subunit repressed the Nrf2-ARE pathway at transcriptional level by competitive interaction with the CH1-KIX domain of CBP or local histone hypoacetylation [25]. All these findings indicate the potential complicate crosstalk between NF-kappaB and Nrf2, which may be regulated by the upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) pathway [26].\nIt has been confirmed that Nrf2 is mainly detected in nucleus of astrocytes after TBI [18]. In view of the fact that Nrf2 is a transcription factor which should take function mainly in nucleus, it can be reasoned that astrocytes may be one kind of respondent cells in activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway after TBI. Previous study identified the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in cultured astrocytes after treatment with LPS or oxyhemoglobin [27, 28]. Another study revealed that after middle cerebral artery occlusion, MMP9-positive astrocytes were observed in brain tissues by immunohistochemistry [29]. Those results indicate the role of astrocytes in inflammatory process after brain injury. But till now, there is no study focused on the relationship among astrocytes, Nrf2, and proinflammatory mediators after TBI. Our results demonstrated the upregulated expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and MMP9 in Nrf2 knockout astrocytes after scratch injury for the first time.\nIn conclusion, depletion of Nrf2 induced the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and MMP9 resulting in more cell deaths in astrocytes after scratch injury. These results suggest that Nrf2 may be an important target for anti-inflammatory therapy after TBI.",

        "inputsentence": "Regulation ofMycobacterium tuberculosis-Dependent HIV-1 Transcription Reveals a New Role for NFAT5 in the Toll-Like Receptor Pathway\nTuberculosis (TB) disease in HIV co-infected patients contributes to increased mortality by activating innate and adaptive immune signaling cascades that stimulate HIV-1 replication, leading to an increase in viral load. Here, we demonstrate that silencing of the expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) by RNA interference (RNAi) inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb)-stimulated HIV-1 replication in co-infected macrophages. We show that NFAT5 gene and protein expression are strongly induced by MTb, which is a Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand, and that an intact NFAT5 binding site in the viral promoter of R5-tropic HIV-1 subtype B and subtype C molecular clones is required for efficent induction of HIV-1 replication by MTb. Furthermore, silencing by RNAi of key components of the TLR pathway in human monocytes, including the downstream signaling molecules MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6, significantly inhibits MTb-induced NFAT5 gene expression. Thus, the innate immune response to MTb infection induces NFAT5 gene and protein expression, and NFAT5 plays a crucial role in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication via a direct interaction with the viral promoter. These findings also demonstrate a general role for NFAT5 in TLR- and MTb-mediated control of gene expression.",

        "inputsentence": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is the most common co-infection and cause of death in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [1], [2]. Direct engagement of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) by MTb on mononuclear phagocytes activates signaling cascades that directly induce transcription from the proviral LTR (reviewed in [3]). Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by the human host in response to MTb infection activate signal transduction pathways in CD4 T cells and monocytic cells that also result in transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR [4]-[6]. Activation of HIV-1 replication via these MTb-induced pathways ultimately leads to higher viral loads and, in turn, expedited CD4 T cell loss and progression to AIDS ([7], reviewed in [8]-[10]). Furthermore, the progressive immune compromise associated with HIV-1 infection itself is a major cause of latent MTb reactivation, as well as increased susceptibility to primary TB infection ([11]-[15], reviewed in [8]).\nThe primary PRR on monocytic cells triggered by MTb infection is toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 [16]-[20]. Engagement of TLR2 results in engagement of the adaptor protein MyD88 and the subsequent recruitment of several kinases, including IRAK1 and IRAK4, and the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 ([21]-[23], reviewed in [10], [24]). TRAF6 activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that, in turn, ultimately induce activation of specific transcription factor families, including the NF-kappaB and AP-1 families, which have been shown to associate with the HIV-1 LTR and to drive its transcription ([22], [25]-[27], reviewed in [10]).\nNotably, HIV-1 comprises several subtypes, and the LTR of each subtype is unique with respect to the number and organization of activator binding sites. For example, HIV-1 subtype B, the most highly characterized viral subtype and the primary cause of infection in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Australia, has two tandem NF-kappaB motifs in its LTR. By contrast, HIV-1 subtypes C and E, which have spread disproportionately in TB-burdened sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, have three and one NF-kappaB binding sites, respectively [1], [28]-[30].\nWe previously showed that the most primordial member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family, NFAT5 (also known as TonEBP), binds to a site within the HIV-1 LTR that is highly conserved across all HIV-1 subtypes, and is also conserved in HIV-2 and SIV LTRs. This NFAT5 site overlaps the core NF-kappaB binding motifs in the LTR and is required for constitutive replication of representative HIV-1 subtype B, C, and E isolates in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) [31]. Given that NFAT5 has previously been shown to be transcriptionally activated by the MAP kinase p38, which is downstream of MyD88 signaling, [32], we speculated that NFAT5 may also be involved in MTb-induced activation of HIV-1 replication via a TLR-mediated pathway in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).\nHere, we show that NFAT5 and its cognate binding site are of crucial importance for efficient MTb-induced stimulation of HIV-1 replication in human MDM and PBMC. Moreover, we demonstrate that MTb infection increases NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes in a MyD88-dependent manner. Thus, these results expand the known stimuli of NFAT5 expression to the PRR-mediated innate immune response, and demonstrate that NFAT5 is a critical modulator of MTb-induced enhancement of HIV-1 replication.",

After overnight virus infection, the cells were then co-infected with the MTb clinical strain CDC1551. Free virus levels were then measured in culture supernatants from MDM transfected with NFAT5-specific siRNA or GFP control siRNA at days 6, 9 and 12 post-HIV-1 infection to measure the impact of NFAT5 inhibition on MTb-induced HIV replication.\nAs shown in Figure 2C, HIV-1 replication was suppressed at days 6 and 9 post-infection in the NFAT5 siRNA-treated cells as compared to cells treated with control siRNA, and it was significantly inhibited by day 12 post-infection (p<0.05) (Figure 2C). Thus, knock down of NFAT5 expression significantly impairs HIV-1 subtype B replication in MDM co-infected with MTb.",

        "inputsentence": "NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding to the HIV-1 LTR can be specifically disrupted\nTo demonstrate that the impact of NFAT5 silencing on MTb-induced viral replication was a direct effect due to modulation of recruitment of NFAT5 to the HIV-1 LTR and not due to secondary, NFAT5-regulated effects, we set out to disrupt NFAT5 binding to the viral LTR in the context of HIV-1/MTb co-infection. This series of experiments also allowed us to dissect the relative importance of NFAT5 and NF-kappaB binding to the HIV-1 LTR in MTb regulation of HIV-1 replication.\nTo perform these experiments, we constructed a panel of infectious HIV-1Lai/Bal-env molecular clones where either the NFAT5 site was specifically disrupted or the two NF-kappaB binding sites were either individually or dually disrupted (Figure 3A). Specifically, we constructed a clone in which the NFAT5 binding site was mutated (named HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut) by changing the CC dinucleotide to TT in the core NFAT5 binding site and introduced substitution mutations into the NF-kappaB/NFAT5 shared binding element that we predicted would disrupt NF-kappaB binding but preserve NFAT5 binding. Specifically, we mutated two guanines (GG) in the kappaB I site and changed them to thymine and adenine (TA) (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-mut) and also introduced the same GG to TA change in the second, more distal NF-kappaB site (kappaB II) in HIV-1Lai/Bal-env (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut). We also created a double NF-kappaB site mutant virus (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut) in order to test the impact of complete disruption of NF-kappaB binding to the HIV-1 LTR on MTb regulation.\nTo determine the specificity of these substitutions upon NFAT5 and NF-kappaB p50/p65 binding to the LTR, we performed a quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis using the wild-type LTR or mutant LTRs in combination with increasing concentrations of recombinant NFAT5 or NF-kappaB p50/p65 proteins. As shown in Figure 3B, the N5-Mut LTR could not bind NFAT5 (compare lanes 12-15 and lanes 17-20), but p50/p65 binding was not impaired (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10). By contrast, changing the GG dinucleotide to TA in either NF-kappaB binding motif, as predicted, inhibited p50/p65 binding at each site (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10 and lanes 12-15 of Figure 3C). As expected, mutation of both NF-kappaB sites (kappaB I+II-Mut) resulted in abrogation of p50/p65 binding to the LTR. However, recombinant NFAT5 binding to the single and the double NF-kappaB mutant LTRs was not impaired and indeed appeared enhanced (compare lanes 2-5 to lanes 7-20 of Figure 3D). Thus, binding of NFAT5 or NF-kappaB p50/p65 to their respective motifs can be specifically disrupted within an overlapping or shared binding site.",

After overnight infection, cells were co-infected with MTb (CDC1551) or mock-infected and free virus levels were detected by measuring p24 levels in culture supernatants at days 4, 7, and 12 post-HIV-1 infection.\nReplication of each mutant virus was reduced in comparison to wild-type virus in mock- and MTb-co-infected cells at all timepoints examined (Figures 4A-4B). As depicted in the histograms displayed in Figure 4C, at day 12 post-HIV-1 infection in MTb-co-infected cells there was a significant reduction in levels of HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut, and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env -N5-Mut in comparison to wild-type virus (Figure 4C).

None of the mutations completely abolished viral induction by MTb co-infection. However, the replication of each mutant virus was impaired to a more significant extent in the context of MTb co-infection, consistent with important roles for both NF-kappaB and NFAT5 in MTb-induced HIV-1 replication.\nTo specifically examine the functional impact of NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding site usage in MDM, which are efficiently infected by both pathogens, we next isolated MDM from four normal donors and infected these cells with 1000 TCID50 of wild-type HIV-1Lai/Bal-env or with the mutant viral clones HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut, HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut, or HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut. After overnight incubation, cell cultures were co-infected with MTb (CDC1551) or left infected with virus alone. Supernatants were collected at days 4, 7, and 12 post-HIV-1 infection and virus replication was measured. As shown in Figures 5A and 5C, in the absence of MTb co-infection, replication of mutant viral molecular clones (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut (p<0.05), HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut (p<0.01), and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut (p<0.01) as well as HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-N5-Mut (p<0.01) were significantly reduced in comparison to the wild-type virus (Figures 5A-5C).\nWhen the cultures were co-infected with MTb, p24 levels increased when the cells were infected with either the wild-type or, to lower levels, with the kappaB-I mutant virus (Figure 5B). However, p24 levels were significantly inhibited in cells infected with HIV-1Lai/Bal-env -N5-Mut (p<0.01) (Figure 5D). Moreover, p24 levels were significantly lower at day 12 in cultures infected with HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB II-Mut and HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I+II-Mut as compared to infection of cells with wild-type virus (Figure 5D). Notably, although replication of the mutant virus with the single, proximal NF-kappaB binding site mutation in the shared NFAT5/NF-kappaB element (HIV-1Lai/Bal-env-kappaB I-Mut) was diminished, this was not significant at day 12 (Figures 5B-5D).\nWe note that overall p24 levels were noticeably lower in the cultures co-infected with MTb compared with those infected with HIV-1 alone. This is consistent with previous observations showing that MTb infection of human primary macrophage cultures ex vivo suppresses HIV-1 infection due to chemokine synthesis and the enhanced expression of cellular inhibitory factors [48]-[50]. Given that NF-kappaB is efficiently activated in primary MDM in response to TLR agonists [51] and as we have shown in Figure 2, NFAT5 gene expression is also induced by TLR agonists, MDM are a suitable experimental system to analyze the effect of NF-kappaB versus NFAT5 binding site mutations on virus replication in isolated MDM in the absence or presence of MTb co-infection. Taken together, the results from PBMC and MDM co-infection experiments demonstrate that the conserved NFAT5 binding site plays as important a transcriptional role in LTR regulation by MTb as do the NF-kappaB sites.",

Subtype C LTRs generally have three functional NF-kappaB sites in their LTRs, and subtype C is the predominant viral subtype in the African and Asian HIV-1 epidemics where MTb co-infection is extremely common [1], [2], [28], [52]. We thus next extended our analysis of the role of NFAT5 in MTb/HIV-1 co-infection to a subtype C isolate. We first constructed an infectious molecular clone of the HIV-1 subtype C primary isolate HIV-198IN22, which has two NFAT5 binding sites in its LTR and three NF-kappaB sites (Figure 6A). We disrupted the two NFAT5 binding sites by changing the TT of each site to CC to create a mutant virus that we named HIV-198IN22-N5-Mut. Bulk PBMC from four normal donors were infected overnight with 1000 TCID50 of wild-type HIV-198IN22 or HIV-198IN22-N5-Mut and the cultures were then co-infected with MTb CDC1551 or left infected with virus alone. At day 11 post-viral infection, wild-type HIV-198IN22 replication was greater, but not significantly so, as compared to replication of HIV-198IN22 NFAT5-Mut (Figure 6B). However, in the context of MTb co-infection, wild-type HIV-198IN22 replication was significantly increased (p<0.05) at day 11 over HIV-198IN22 NFAT5-Mut replication (Figure 6C), indicating that the absence of NFAT5 binding sites was particularly detrimental to virus replication in the presence of MTb co-infection. Thus, even when three functional NF-kappaB binding sites are present in the LTR, as in the HIV-1 subtype C infectious clone studied here, disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR impairs virus replication in response to MTb co-infection.",

        "inputsentence": "MTb induces NFAT5 gene expression via the MyD88-dependent signaling cascade\nTo begin to decipher the cellular mechanisms underlying NFAT5-dependent, MTb-induced HIV-1 replication, we next investigated the requirement for specific signaling molecules in the TLR pathway that are required for MTb stimulation of NFAT5 gene expression. We began by examining the requirement of TLR2 ligation in enhancing NFAT5 mRNA levels. When THP-1 cells were treated with the TLR2-specific agonist Pam3Cys for 16 hours, NFAT5 mRNA levels were significantly increased in Pam3Cys-stimulated cells as compared to mock-stimulated control cells (Figure 7A). As a positive control for this experiment we also infected THP-1 cells with CDC1551 (Figure 7A). Notably, MTb infection enhanced NFAT5 mRNA levels to a greater extent than Pam3Cys stimulation, suggesting that additional PRRs may be triggered during actual MTb infection, augmenting its stimulatory effect on NFAT5 gene expression (Figure 7A).\nThe adaptor molecule MyD88 transmits signals upon TLR2 ligation (reviewed in [53]). To confirm that this protein and, therefore, that this TLR-dependent pathway is important for MTb induction of NFAT5 gene expression, we constructed a THP-1 cell line that constitutively expresses a lentivirally-delivered short hairpin (sh)RNA targeting MyD88. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that MyD88 mRNA levels in these cells were constitutively and significantly reduced in comparison to control THP-1 cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing control GFP shRNA (data not shown). These MyD88 knockdown THP-1 cells were then infected with MTb (CDC1551) and NFAT5 mRNA levels were examined. Since TNF is a MyD88-dependent gene [21], [54], [55], as a positive control we measured TNF mRNA levels. For a negative control, we measured mRNA levels of the MyD88-independent gene CD86 [55], [56]. As shown in Figure 7B, knockdown of MyD88 specifically inhibited MTb-induced NFAT5 and TNF mRNA levels and had no impact on CD86 mRNA levels. Thus, MTb regulation of NFAT5 is dependent upon MyD88.\nTo futher dissect the pathway mediating MTb upregulation of NFAT5 transcription, we also constructed THP-1 cells transduced with lentivirally-delivered shRNAs targeting IRAK1 or TRAF6, two signaling molecules downstream of MyD88. As shown in Figures 7C and 7D, knockdown of both IRAK1 and TRAF6 significantly inhibited MTb induced NFAT5 mRNA levels. As expected, MTb-induced TNF gene expression was also significantly reduced (Figures 7C-7D), consistent with a role for IRAK1 and TRAF6 in TNF gene expression secondary to MTb infection as previously reported. Although CD86 gene expression did not depend on MyD88 (Figure 7B), abrogation of IRAK1 and TRAF6 gene expression significantly reduced CD86 mRNA levels, indicating that CD86 expression is IRAK1- and TRAF6-dependent, but MyD88-independent in MTb-infected monocytes (Figures 7C-7D). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that MTb upregulation of NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytic cells requires activation of MyD88 and the MyD88-associated adaptor molecules IRAK1 and TRAF6.",

        "inputsentence": "The transcription factor NFAT5 is the most evolutionarily divergent member of the Rel family of NFAT proteins [57]. Unlike the other NFAT proteins (NFATp, NFATc, NFAT3, and NFAT4), NFAT5 binds DNA as an obligate dimer in a fashion resembling NF-kappaB proteins [58], is calcineurin independent, and does not cooperate with the basic region-leucine zipper proteins Fos and Jun in gene activation ([59], [60], reviewed in [61]-[63]). To date, osmotic stress, integrin activation, and T cell-stimulation have been shown to regulate NFAT5 activity [59], [64], [65]. Based on our demonstration here that the host innate immune response to MTb infection induces MyD88-dependent upregulation of NFAT5 gene expression, we have expanded this list to include MTb as an additional stimulus. We have linked this observation to MTb-stimulated HIV-1 gene expression by showing that MTb enhances the replication of HIV-1 subtypes B and C via a direct interaction between NFAT5 and the viral promoter. Thus, HIV-1 has co-opted NFAT5, which is induced as part of the innate immune response to TB, for enhanced viral transcription/replication.\nNF-kappaB is activated after MTb engagement of PRRs [20], [66]. Multiple studies of HIV-1 activation have shown that initial recruitment of the NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer to the HIV-1 proviral enhancer region is crucial for HIV gene transcription (reviewed in [67], [68]). Upon interaction with the viral LTR, NF-kappaB rapidly induces hyperacetylation of histones associated with nucleosome 1 (nuc-1) at the HIV-1 transcription start site, resulting in recruitment of the pTEFb complex, which is required for RNA pol II processivity ([69], reviewed in [68], [70]).\nIn this report we directly examined the relative roles of NFAT5 and NF-kappaB p50/p65 in HIV-1 replication under conditions of activation by MTb co-infection, when NF-kappaB levels in the nucleus are elevated. We found that specific disruption of the NFAT5 binding site(s) in R5-tropic subtype B or subtype C infectious molecular clones significantly reduced virus replication in PBMC or MDM co-infected with a clinical isolate of MTb. Thus, NF-kappaB binding to the viral LTR is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 binding to the LTR under conditions of MTb co-infection. Reciprocally, an intact NFAT5 site could not compensate for disruption of the two NF-kappaB sites. Thus, both factors are required for MTb-induced HIV-1 replication.\nIntriguingly, both in the absence and presence of MTb co-infection, disruption of NF-kappaB site II consistently resulted in greater suppression of virus replication than disruption of NF-kappaB site I. Consistent with these findings, synthetic reporter assays have previously shown that these two sites have distinct roles in driving transcription. The downstream NF-kappaB site I binding site, which is directly upstream of three highly conserved Sp binding sites, appears to enhance Sp protein recruitment to the LTR [71]-[73]. Because NF-kappaB site I overlaps the NFAT5 binding site, it is possible that loss of NF-kappaB binding to this site is mitigated, at least in part, by increased NFAT5 binding to the mutated site. This hypothesis is consistent with our quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis that shows that specific disruption of NF-kappaB site I results in enhanced binding of NFAT5 to the LTR.\nHIV-1 subtype C now makes up greater than 50% of all HIV-1 infections worldwide, and its prevalence is especially high in regions of endemic TB [1], [2], [28], [52], Most HIV-1 subtype C isolates possess three NF-kappaB binding sites in the LTR [30]. Our analysis of MTb whole lysate-stimulated, LTR-driven reporter gene expression from representative B, C, and E LTRs showed that LTRs derived from subtype C isolates were superior in driving reporter gene expression as compared to LTRs derived from subtype B or E isolates. Other studies have found that, in response to TNF, subtype C LTRs drive reporter gene transcription more strongly than other subtype LTRs [38], [39]. In the co-infection model utilized in this report, in which clinical isolates of both MTb and HIV-1 subtype C were used to infect freshly prepared human peripheral blood cells, we found that specific disruption of NFAT5 binding to the LTR significantly impaired viral replication during MTb co-infection, indicating that even the presence of three intact NF-kappaB binding sites, which is typical for HIV-1 subtype C isolates [30], cannot compensate for loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral LTR in the context of MTb co-infection.\nGiven that the NF-kappaB and NFAT5 binding motifs overlap, how do NF-kappaB and NFAT5 function at this overlapping or shared site in the LTR to drive viral transcription in response to MTb infection? Because NFAT5 expression continues to rise for at least 48 hours post-MTb infection (Figure 2A), one possibility is that the host factors NF-kappaB and NFAT5 associate with the LTR at different stages after viral activation. While NF-kappaB presence in the nucleus declines in the hours post MTb infection [74], [75], NFAT5 levels escalate. Thus, NFAT5, which is pivotal for HIV-1 transcription in unstimulated cells [31], may, after Mtb infection, perpetuate viral transcriptional initiation begun by NF-kappaB and, with Tat levels also elevated, promote high levels of sustained HIV-1 transcription. Indeed, in response to hypertonic stress, NFAT5 binds to the aldose reductase (AR) promoter and induces rapid hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 [76]. Furthermore, hypertonic stress of mouse renal collecting duct epithelial cells results in NFAT5 and NF-kappaB complex formation at NF-kappaB-dependent gene promoters [77]. Thus, there are precedents for imagining that NFAT5 could function at the HIV-1 LTR by inducing histone remodeling in a manner similar to NF-kappaB ([69], reviewed in [68], [70]) or by directly interacting with NF-kappaB in a cooperative manner.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that NFAT5 is required for the replication of R5-tropic subtype B and subtype C HIV-1 isolates in response to MTb-co-infection of human PBMC and MDM. Functional NF-kappaB interaction with the viral LTR is also required, but fully intact NF-kappaB binding elements are unable to compensate for the loss of NFAT5 recruitment to the viral promoter. In addition, we have demonstrated that MTb infection or stimulation with the TLR2 ligand PAM3Cys, induces NFAT5 gene expression in human monocytes. Furthermore, we have shown that MTb stimulation of NFAT5 depends on TLR pathway signaling molecules, including MyD88, IRAK1, and TRAF6. Taken together, the findings presented here enhance the general understanding of the innate immune response to MTb infection by showing that NFAT5 is a major mediator of TLR-dependent gene expression; its importance for gene regulation is likely applicable to other MTb- and TLR-regulated genes. Moreover, these data provide molecular insights into MTb regulation of HIV-1 transcription, thereby elucidating several new targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at controlling TB/HIV-1 co-infection.",

        "inputsentence": "Chemokines are small soluble molecules that are best known for their potent ability to induce cancer cell growth by inflammation. Many types of cancer cells express chemokines and chemokine receptors [1]. The accumulated evidence indicates that the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) and C-C chemokine receptor (CCR5), which are potent chemotactic factors for inflammatory cells, may be significantly involved in the proliferation and metastasis of several cancers. Intermediate and strong CCR5 expression is significantly associated with nonmetastatic development of colorectal cancer [2], melanoma [3], hepatoma [4], glioblastoma, Hodgkin lymphoma [5], as well as oral and prostate cancer cells [6]. Local production of the CCL5 is also important in the progression of breast cancer [7], and also correlates with poor prognosis [8]. Meanwhile, CCR5 disruption has been demonstrated to inhibit experimental tumor growth and metastasis of pancreatic cancer [9]. In addition, host absence of CCR5 potentiates the delay of tumor growth [10], and CCR5 inhibitors prevented cancer cell growth, such as prostate cancer [11], breast cancer, hepatoma cells [4], and lung cancer [12]. These data suggest that the deficiency of inflammatory chemokine receptor CCR5 may function as a suppressive receptor in cancer progression. However, more studies are required to describe how CCR5 deficiency acts in the inhibition of tumor development.\nInterleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a member of the IL-1 family, is a naturally occurring cytokine that competitively blocks the IL-1 receptor [13]. Because IL-1Ra has been shown to inhibit tumor progression by promoting antitumor immune responses and by enhancing the activity of chemotherapy, numerous studies have examined the ability of IL-1Ra to block tumor progression. IL-1Ra expression was reduced in prostate [14], breast [15], and skin cancer [16]. It was also reported that endogenous IL-1Ra deficient mice developed aggressive tumors following exposure to carcinogens [17]. Meanwhile, proliferation of the melanoma cells that were transduced with IL-1Ra gene was reduced and inhibited melanoma development [18]. IL-1R blockade also reduced hepatic tumor growth [19]. Moreover, it has also been reported that IL-1Ra reduces fibrosarcoma development [20], B16 melanoma growth and metastasis [21], colon adenocarcinoma growth [22], and skin cancer development [23]. IL-1 knockout mice injected with melanoma failed to develop solid tumors [24]. It was also found that IL-1Ra, combined with temozolomide and docetaxel chemotherapy, demonstrated more significant antitumor activity against B16 melanoma cells in vivo [25]. These data indicate that IL-1Ra is important as a tumor growth suppressing cytokine.\nNF-kappaB plays a crucial role in the suppression of apoptosis, as well as the induction of cell proliferation and inflammation, and is closely associated with cancer development [26]. Constitutive activation of NF-kappaB has been described in a great number of cancers including colon cancers, prostate cancers and melanoma [27], and was found to up-regulate anti-apoptotic genes and/or down regulate apoptotic gene expression [28]. Although NF-kappaB promotes tumor growth, it is required for the immune system to function normally [29]. Studies on c-Rel-deficient mice demonstrated that c-Rel is essential for IL-2, IL-3, GM-CSF, and IFNgamma expression in T lymphocytes [30]. C-Rel-deficient mice also have a tissue-specific deficiency of various cytokines and growth factors in T cells and macrophages affecting both innate and humoral immune responses in the host [31]. Therefore, NF-kappaB can be specially targeted to prevent cancer cell growth by (1) directly affecting apoptotic cancer cell death, (2) stimulating tumor killing lymphocytes infiltration or (3) increasing the production of tumor killing lymphokines. Activation of NF-kappaB is important in the regulation of CCR-mediated tumor growth and metastasis. It was reported that inhibition of NF-kappaB by dehydroxymethyl-epoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) induces cell death of primary effusion lymphoma by inhibition of CCR5 expression [32]. Activation of NF-kappaB also increases CCL5-mediated oral cancer motility (5) and lung metastasis [33]. Thus, it is possible that inhibition of NF-kappaB could be involved in CCR5 mediated tumor development.\nNF-kappaB transcription factor binding sites are present in the promoter region of proinflammatory cytokine genes, such as IL-1alpha, IL-6, GM-CSF, and KC [34]. On the other hand, the IL-1Ra is a negative regulator of the inflammatory response. Several studies have demonstrated the ability of IL-1Ra to abrogate the proinflammatory effects of IL-1. Smith et al. suggested that the regulation of IL-1Ra gene expression is a complex event involving the interactions of three different transcription factors; NF-kappaB/PU.1/GA-binding protein binding site [35]. Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB (p65) was significantly enhanced and prolonged in IL-1Ra-deficient mice, compared to that in wild type mice [36]. Intracellular IL-1Ra (icIL-1Ra) was found to inhibit IL-1 by blocking NF-kappaB signal transduction pathways in inflammatory responses [37]. Because IL-1 has been shown to be an inducer of NF-kappaB activation [38], we hypothesized that the expression of IL-1Ra could play an important role in the autocrine activation of transcription factors NF-kappaB or vice versa. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the roles of NF-kappaB and IL-1Ra in the chemokine receptor CCR5-mediated suppression of tumor development.",

        "inputsentence": "In the present study, we found that tumor weight and volume were much smaller in the CCR5-/- mice compared to the CCR5+/+ mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells (Figure 1A and 1B). The tumor growth inhibition in the CCR5-/- mice was associated with the inhibition of constitutively activated NF-kappaB and elevation of IL-1Ra in the tumor tissue. This anti-tumor activity was also associated with decreased expression of NF-kappaB target anti-apoptotic, cell proliferative, and tumor promoting genes (Bcl-2 and C-IAP1) but with increased expression of their target apoptotic genes; cleaved caspase-3 and 9, and Bax (Figure 3A-D). In the tumor and the spleen, the number of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, CD57+ natural killer cells, and the levels of IL-1Ra were increased (Figure 4 and 5). These findings suggest that melanoma growth was inhibited in the CCR5-/- mice, and that the elevation of IL-1Ra, accompanied with decreased NF-kappaB, is significant in the inhibition of melanoma growth in CCR5-/- mice.\nNF-kappaB regulates the expression of over 200 genes that control the immune system, cancer cell growth and inflammation [39]. Because of its abilities to induce the expression of a large array of inflammatory mediators and its roles as core transcription factors in diverse immune responses, NF-kappaB has been recognized as a major factor responsible for cytokine-associated cancer development or anti-tumor immunity. In the melanoma tumor tissues of the CCR5-/- mice, the expression of NF-kappaB target cell death genes (Bax, caspase-3 and 9) and the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB, were significantly inhibited, but the expression of cell death inhibitory NF-kappaB target genes, such as Bcl-2 and cIAP were enhanced. In addition, CCR5-/- prevented the phosphorylation of IkappaB, accompanied with the inhibition of the p50 and p65 translocation into the nucleus (Figure 2A-C). Many tumors, including melanoma, have increased levels of NF-kappaB [40], which is likely acting as a survival factor for melanoma growth. Thus, the inhibitions of NF-kappaB activity and the expression of target genes are critical in the inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5-/- mice. Although the mechanism is not clear as to how CCR5-/- downregulates NF-kappaB, it is noteworthy that NF-kappaB is activated or inactivated by many cytokines.\nNumerous studies showed that cytokine affect tumor growth by regulating NF-kappaB. Inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8, activate NF-kappaB pathways in tumor cells [41]. The interleukin 10 (IL-10) is well known as an anti-tumor factor as well as an anti-inflammatory factor [42], [43]. IL-10 inhibits constitutively activated NF-kappaB both in vitro [44] and in vivo [45]. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by the IL-10 contributes to the anti-tumor effects through the activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis in Colon26-bearing mice [43]. Similarly, several studies have demonstrated the ability of IL-1Ra to abrogate the proinflammatory effects of IL-1 [46]. It has been reported that IL-1 induces the activation of NF-kappaB in several cancers, and increases cell cycle progression, and the suppression of apoptotic cell death leading to tumor promotion. The results of various studies over the past 10 years indicate that the major function of IL-1Ra is to regulate the pleiotropic effects of IL-1 by competitively blocking its functions [47]. The ability of IL-1 to induce its own antagonist is of interest in understanding the regulation and dysregulation of IL-1 signaling in normal and diseased tissue. Up-regulation of the receptor antagonist represents a mechanism for turning off IL-1 signaling and creating a temporary state of refractoriness. The elevated expression of IL-1Ra, without any change of IL-1 in tumors, suggests that the IL-1-signaling system may be dysregulated by IL-1Ra in tumors. IL-1Ra has been shown to inhibit tumor progression in prostate, breast, and skin cancer [14], [15], [16]. Intracellular IL-1Ra (icIL-1Ra) inhibits IL-6 and IL-8 production in Caco-2 cells by blocking NF-kappaB pathways [37]. We found that the levels of IL-1Ra were significantly elevated in the tumor tissues of CCR5-/- mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells. Taken together, these data indicate IL-1Ra could be critically involved in the tumor growth inhibition of CCR5-/- mice through the inactivation of NF-kappaB in the present study.\nCCR5 increases tumor growth in a local model and inhibits the efficacy of a dendrite cell vaccine in CCR5+/+ mice compared with CCR5-/- mice [10]. Cheng J and Sung RS examined the effect of CCR5 on the immune response to adenovirus vectors and graft function in an islet transplant model. They found that CCR5 absence does not prevent the local immune response to adenovirus transduction [48]. Additionally, Tan MC et al. suggested that disruption of CCR5/CCL5 signaling, either by reducing CCL5 production by tumor cells or by systemic administration of a CCR5 inhibitor (TAK-779), reduced Treg (regulatory T cells) migration to tumors so that tumors are smaller in control mice [9]. These data support the important premise that inhibition of tumor growth in CCR5-/- mice could be related with the inhibition of immune escape. Similar to this finding, we found that the CCR5+/+ mice injected with melanoma cells apparently have a lower number of cytotoxic T cells (CD8+positive T Lymphocytes cells) and natural killer cells (CD57 positive NK cells), as well as dendrite cells, in spleen tissues compared to those without melanoma cells. But the lymphocytes of the CCR5-/- mice did not decrease when injected with melanoma cells. These differences of the immune response between the CCR5+/+ mice and the CCR5-/- mice, involving tumor immune tolerance, may be connected with the inhibition of cancer progression. Taken together, in the cytokine array experiment, the level of MIP-1alpha (which has a potent activity of T cell and B cell migration) was increased in the CCR5-/- mice compared with those in the CCR5+/+ mice. Thus, relatively increased tumor associated cytotoxic lymphocytes could play an important role in inhibiting the tumor growth in CCR5-/- mice.\nActivation of NF-kappaB could modulate subcellular localization of NK cells and pathogenesis [49]. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity prevented NK cell depletion, and thus increased anti-tumor activity by decreasing IL-6 production [50]. Thus, the decreased NF-kappaB and elevated IL-1Ra could also be associated in the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes into tumor, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. In contrast, IL-23, a tumor growth promoting cytokine, increased NF-kappaB and immune cell infiltration in oral tumor [51]. These data indicate that NF-kappaB could be involved in the cytokine mediated anti-tumor activities of immune cells. It is also noteworthy that IL-1Ra inhibited melanoma tumor growth by increasing the number of myeloid suppressor cells in tumor [25]. The 3-methylcholatrene-induced tumor incidence was reduced in IL-1alpha knockout mice, but increased in IL-1Ra mice with concomitant maturation of NK cells and anti-tumor immunity [52]. These data indicate that the decrease of NF-kappaB, and thus increase of IL-1Ra could be significant in tumor growth inhibition of CCR5-/- mice.\nOur data thus show significant clinical implications of CCR5, because CCR5 is a G protein-coupled receptor and it is amenable to use as a small molecule for the inhibition of CCR5. Several such compounds have already been shown to be safe in clinical trials for use in certain diseases such as HIV [53]. Thus, we believe CCR5 is a cancer target that warrants continued investigation. In summary, this study showed that melanoma cells growth was inhibited via modulation of NF-kappaB/IL-1Ra pathways in CCR5-/- mice.",

In this work, we investigated the signaling mechanisms controlled by the necroptosis mediator receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP1) kinase. We show that Akt kinase activity is critical for necroptosis in L929 cells and plays a key role in TNFalpha production. During necroptosis, Akt is activated in a RIP1 dependent fashion through its phosphorylation on Thr308. In L929 cells, this activation requires independent signaling inputs from both growth factors and RIP1. Akt controls necroptosis through downstream targeting of mammalian Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Akt activity, mediated in part through mTORC1, links RIP1 to JNK activation and autocrine production of TNFalpha. In other cell types, such as mouse lung fibroblasts and macrophages, Akt exhibited control over necroptosis-associated TNFalpha production without contributing to cell death. Overall, our results provide new insights into the mechanism of necroptosis and the role of Akt kinase in both cell death and inflammatory regulation.",

        "inputsentence": "Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that displays all the major hallmarks of necrosis [1]. A growing number of studies have implicated necroptosis in a wide range of animal models of human disease, including brain, heart and retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury, acute pancreatitis, brain trauma, retinal detachment, and Huntington's disease [2], [3]. Importantly, several recent studies have linked necroptosis to models of inflammation including intestinal inflammation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [4], [5], [6]. The discovery of a regulated form of necrotic death could uncover molecular targets amenable to pharmacological intervention for the treatment of various conditions.\nA complex consisting of two related Ser/Thr kinases, RIP1 and RIP3, plays a critical role in the initiation of necroptosis in multiple systems [7], [8], [9]. A recent genome wide siRNA screen for mediators of necroptosis induced by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk in mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells, revealed a broad and diverse cellular network of 432 genes that may regulate this process [10]. These data provided important confirmation of the highly regulated nature of necroptosis and revealed the first insight into the full repertoire of mediators of this form of cell death. However, the specific signaling pathways activated during necroptosis and their connections to RIP1 and RIP3 remain poorly understood. Several recent studies [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] have suggested that JNK kinase activation plays an important role during necroptosis in L929 cells downstream from RIP1 kinase. For example, the transcription factor c-Jun, a key cellular target of JNK activity, was one of the hits in the genome wide siRNA screen [10]. Activation of JNK in L929 cells has been linked to autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, activation of oxidative stress and induction of autophagy, all of which contribute to necroptosis. Importantly, RIP1 kinase dependent activation of JNK and TNFalpha production has recently been described to be independent of its role in necroptosis [15]. Curiously, Akt kinase, a key pro-survival molecule and a well-established inhibitor of apoptotic cell death, has also recently been linked to necroptosis in L929 cells [16], where insulin-dependent activation of Akt was suggested to promote necroptosis by suppressing autophagy. This conclusion was unexpected, since several reports from different groups, including ours, have established that autophagy promotes, rather than suppresses, zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis in L929 cells [11], [14], [17]. This raised the possibility that Akt controls more general mechanisms that contribute to the execution of necroptosis. Furthermore, the key question of whether insulin-dependent Akt activity solely provides an environment conducive for necroptosis or if Akt activation is an intrinsic component of necroptosis signaling that is linked to RIP1 kinase has not been explored.\nIn this study, we expanded these observations to delineate the specific contributions and molecular ordering of the Akt and JNK pathways downstream from RIP1 kinase during necroptosis. Our data reveal that Akt is activated through RIP1 kinase-dependent Thr308 phosphorylation during necroptosis in multiple cell types. Furthermore, we found that downstream Akt signaling through mTORC1 and S6 contributes to the activation of necroptosis and TNFalpha production. We found that the Akt pathway serves as a critical link between RIP1 kinase and JNK activation in L929 cells. Further data suggested that in multiple other cell types including FADD deficient Jurkat cells, RAW and J774.1 macrophage cell lines, and mouse lung fibroblasts Akt provides a key link to TNFalpha production, but is dispensible for cell death per se. Overall, our results reveal a specific and novel role for the Akt pathway in regulated necrosis and necrosis-associated inflammatory signaling.",

Interestingly, while necroptosis was initially identified as a back-up form of cell death triggered by pro-apoptotic stimuli in the presence of apoptosis inhibitors [17], recent analysis of physiological cell death during mouse development has suggested that the loss of apoptotic regulators, such as caspase-8 and FADD [18], [19], [20], leads to robust induction of necroptosis and death of E10.5 embryos even though apoptosis is not normally induced in wild type embryos. These data are reminiscent of the observations in L929 cells where the loss of caspase activity in healthy cells is sufficient to trigger necroptosis and prompted us to explore the extrinsic or intrinsic cellular factors that promote necroptosis once caspase-8 activity, which cleaves and inactivates RIP1 kinase and the RIP1 deubiquitinase CYLD [21], [22], is removed in L929 cells. Consistent with a previous report [16], we found that serum starvation of L929 cells prevented necroptosis in response to zVAD.fmk (Fig. 1A). The addition of growth factors, such as bFGF, restored zVAD.fmk induced death under serum free conditions (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, this does not reflect a generic requirement for growth factor signaling, as only some growth factors (bFGF and IGF-1, but not EGF and PDGF) promoted death (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, growth factor-dependent necroptosis required the inhibition of caspase activity, as bFGF alone did not induce cell death (Fig. 1C). In contrast, TNFalpha triggered necroptosis equally efficiently in the absence of serum (Fig. 1A), suggesting that either growth factors and zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha are required for necroptotic death in L929 cells.\nPreviously we described the development of 7-Cl-O-Nec-1 (Nec-1) as a potent and selective inhibitor of RIP1 kinase and necroptosis (Fig. S1A) [23], [24]. Recently, its selectivity has been further validated against a panel of more than 400 human kinases [15]. This inhibitor efficiently blocked growth factor/zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis under serum free conditions in L929 cells and both zVAD.fmk and TNFalpha-induced necroptosis under full serum conditions (Fig. 1B, S1B). To further validate the role of RIP1, we used an inactive analog, 7-Cl-O-Nec-1i (Nec-1i) (Fig. S1A), which contains an extra N-methyl group that leads to almost complete loss of RIP1 kinase inhibitory activity in vitro [23]. Nec-1i was unable to protect L929 cell death under serum condtions treated with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha (Fig. S1B) or serum free conditions treated with bFGF/zVAD.fmk (Fig. S1C). This confirms that RIP1 kinase is responsible for necroptosis in L929 cells under both serum and serum free conditions.\nWe next examined whether bFGF contributes to zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis under normal serum conditions (10% FBS). We used two bFGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (PD173074 and PD166866), and determined that inhibition of bFGF signaling strongly inhibited zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis under normal serum conditions (Fig. 1D). In contrast, neither bFGF receptor inhibitor was able to attenuate TNFalpha-induced necroptosis (Fig. 1D), consistent with growth factors being dispensable for this pathway (Fig. 1A). Overall, these data suggest that the induction of necroptosis by zVAD.fmk is promoted by bFGF under both serum and serum free conditions. The induction of necroptosis, however, is not a simple consequence of growth factor signaling since not all growth factors allowed death to occur. Instead, specific signaling events mediated by particular growth factors appear to contribute to necroptotic death.",

        "inputsentence": "RIP1 Kinase-dependent Activation of Akt Contributes to Necroptosis\nGiven our observation that growth factors are important for zVAD.fmk induced death, we examined the contribution of several pathways, including MAPK pathways and Akt, which are known to be activated following growth factor receptor activation (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of Akt (Akt inhibitor VIII) strongly protected the cells from growth factor-sensitive necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk [16] as well as cell death triggered by bFGF or IGF-1/zVAD.fmk under serum free conditions (Fig. 2B). Inhibition of Akt also protected the cells from growth-factor insensitive death by caused by TNFalpha (Fig. 2A). Consistent with previous reports, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 protected the cells from both zVAD.fmk and TNFalpha induced death (Fig. 2A,B and Fig. S2A) [12], [14]. In contrast, inhibition of two other MAPKs, p38 and ERK, previously reported not to be activated during necroptosis [14], did not protect from either zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha induced death (Fig. 2A).\nNext, we used two approaches to further validate the role of Akt in necroptotic cell death. First, two additional Akt inhibitors, a highly specific, allosteric kinase inhibitor MK-2206 [25] and triciribine (TCN) [26], which blocks membrane translocation of Akt, both attenuated cell death (Fig. S2B). Secondly, simultaneous knockdown of Akt isoforms Akt1 and Akt2 using siRNAs protected cells from necroptosis induced by both zVAD.fmk and TNFalpha (Fig. 2C). No expression of Akt3 was seen in L929 cells (Fig. S2C) and, consistently, Akt3 siRNA had no additional effect on necroptosis. Our results confirmed that Akt plays a key role in necroptosis induced by multiple stimuli in L929 cells.\nTo understand the activation of Akt and JNK under necroptotic conditions, we examined the changes in Akt and JNK phosphorylation at 9 hrs post zVAD.fmk and TNFalpha stimulation. This time point was chosen because it reflects the early stage of cell death in our system (Fig. S3A, B). Following stimulation with either zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha we observed a robust increase in Akt phosphorylation at a known major activation site, Thr308 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, we did not observe concomitant phosphorylation changes in the second major activation site of Akt, Ser473. We also observed an increase in the phosphorylation of both the p46 and p54 isoforms of JNK and its major substrate c-Jun (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that both Akt and JNK are activated under necroptotic conditions.\nThe RIP1 kinase inhibitor, Nec-1, completely prevented the increase in Thr308 Akt phosphorylation, while Nec-1i did not (Fig. 3A, Fig. S1D). Similarly, Nec-1 prevented the induction of JNK phosphorylation in response to zVAD.fmk and substantially reduced this change after TNFalpha addition. We observed some changes in total protein levels of JNK and c-Jun following necroptotic stimulation. Some of these changes, e.g. zVAD.fmk-induced increase in c-Jun, were also attenuated by Nec-1. Importantly, Nec-1 did not alter the basal phosphorylation levels of either Akt or JNK (Fig. 3A). This established that Akt Thr308 and JNK phosphorylation during necroptosis is RIP1 dependent.\nInterestingly, we discovered that the phosphorylation of Akt Thr308, JNK and Jun are late events following zVAD.fmk stimulation (Fig. 3B) that coincide with the onset of necroptosis at 6 hr post-stimulation (Fig. S3A). To better understand the contributions of growth factors and RIP1 kinase to necroptotic regulation of Akt, we next analyzed the time course of these phosphorylation changes under serum free conditions. We found that the addition of bFGF alone or in combination with zVAD.fmk led to a substantial rapid and transient increase in both Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt as well as JNK and c-Jun at 15 minutes, reflecting the expected response to growth factor stimulation (Fig. 3C). Significantly, the combination of bFGF/zVAD.fmk, but not bFGF alone, also caused a robust, second, delayed increase in the phosphorylation of Thr308, but not Ser473, of Akt as well as a delayed increase in the phosphorylation of JNK and Jun. Furthermore, Nec-1 had no significant effect on the early increase in both Akt and JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation triggered by both bFGF and bFGF/zVAD, while Nec-1, but not its inactive analog Nec-1i (Fig. S1E), efficiently blocked the bFGF/zVAD increase at 6-9 hr (Fig. 3D), suggesting that only the delayed activation of Akt and JNK is specific for necroptosis and dependent on RIP1 kinase activity. Similarly, IGF/zVAD, which also promoted cell death under serum free conditions, produced a delayed increase in Thr308 phosphorylation on Akt, while IGF alone caused solely an early, transient increase in phosphorylation (Fig. S3C). We confirmed the kinetics of the Akt Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation changes using a quantitative ELISA assay, which also showed a robust delayed necroptosis-specific RIP1-dependent increase in Akt Thr308 phosphorylation (Fig. S3D, E). Taken together, these results indicate that the observed delayed increases in Akt and JNK phosphorylation, preceding the onset of cell death, represent specific consequences of necroptotic signaling downstream from RIP1 kinase.",

Furthermore, addition of TNFalpha led to comparable late activation of Akt p308 signal under both normal and serum free conditions (Fig. S4B, C), indicating that TNFalpha signaling to Akt Thr308 is growth factor-independent. In contrast, activation of JNK by TNFalpha followed different kinetics from zVAD.fmk-induced changes. TNFalpha treatment caused an early and robust increase in the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. Nec-1 did not affect this early increase, however, it reduced levels of pJNK/Jun at the late, 9 hr time point (Fig. S4B, C). This again separated early RIP1-independent changes, which likely reflect the ability of additional upstream kinases, such as Ask1 to activate JNK [27], from the late RIP1 kinase-dependent necroptotic signaling.",

Firstly, PDGF/zVAD.fmk, which cannot induce necroptosis (Fig. 2A), triggered only the initial, rapid Akt and JNK phosphorylation changes and not the delayed activation (Fig. 4A), indicating that late, rather than early Akt phosphorylation correlates with necroptosis. Secondly, we saw that the ability of the Akt inhibitor to protect cells from necroptosis rapidly declined after 6 hrs of stimulation with zVAD.fmk, TNFalpha or bFGF/zVAD.fmk and no protection was observed when the inhibitor was added at 9 hrs (Fig. 4B,C). This time frame coincides with the timing of the secondary Akt Thr308 phosphorylation. Finally, we terminated the bFGF signal one hour after addition of bFGF by the addition of PD173074. This allowed us to retain early Akt activation, but to suppress the secondary increase (Fig. 4D). Both pre-addition and delayed addition of PD173074 fully prevented necroptosis (Fig. 4E). Overall, these data, while correlative, indicate that early Akt activation is insufficient to promote necroptosis and are strongly supportive of an important role for the delayed activation of Akt in the induction of necroptotic cell death.",

        "inputsentence": "The Akt Signaling Pathway Contributes to the Regulation of Necroptosis\nWe next determined whether the necroptosis-associated increase in Thr308 phosphorylation results in an increase in Akt kinase activity. Under necroptotic conditions, we observed an increase in the phosphorylation of multiple known Akt substrates (Forkhead box class O (FoxO) proteins, GSK-3 kinases and mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)) as well as downstream molecules (p70 ribosomal protein S6 Kinase (p70S6K), S6) (Fig. 5A). In some cases (FoxO1, FoxO4, MDM2), a robust increase was observed. In other cases (FoxO3a, GSK-3alpha/beta, p70S6K and its substrate S6), the changes were less pronounced (Fig. 5A). The timing of the phosphorylation changes paralleled the increase in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5B, S5A, B). In the case of pFoxO1 we occasionally observed a shift in migration rather than an increase in band intensity (e.g. comparing Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that phosphorylation events in addition to Thr24 take place during necroptosis. Notably, in all cases the necroptosis-associated increases in Akt substrates were abrogated by Nec-1 (Fig. 5A, Fig. S5A, B). Overall, these data suggested that a significant part of the \"canonical\" Akt signaling network is activated at the onset of necroptotic cell death in a RIP1 dependent fashion.\nAkt kinase is considered to be a pro-survival protein that inhibits apoptosis through the control of multiple effectors including mTORC1, GSK-3 and others [28]. An important question is whether these same molecules reverse their pro-survival roles during necroptosis. We found that inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR co-factor Raptor [29], protected cells from necroptosis (Fig. 5C). Similarly, the direct mTOR kinase inhibitor Torin1 [30] and the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 [31] also efficiently inhibited necroptosis (Fig. 5C). Knockdown of mTOR using siRNA further validated the small-molecule inhibitor data indicating a role for mTOR in necroptosis by protecting cells from both zVAD.fmk and TNFalpha induced death (Fig. 5D).\nmTORC1 regulates translation through activation of p70S6 kinase and, subsequently, ribosomal protein S6 [32]. Notably, a genome-wide siRNA screen [10] suggested an important role for protein translation in necroptosis. Consistently, we found that the small molecule inhibitor of p70S6K PF-4708671 [33] attenuated necroptosis at the concentrations required to block S6 phosphorylation (Fig. S5C, D). Partial siRNA knockdown of S6 protein attenuated necroptosis as well (Fig. S5E), suggesting that translational control by p70S6K/S6 may play a role in necroptosis. Overall, while the full repertoire of Akt targets during necroptosis remains to be fully explored, our data provide evidence that the activity of an anti-apoptotic branch of Akt signaling can promote necroptosis.\nRIP1 kinase, Akt, mTORC1 and JNK control the upregulation of TNFalpha accompanying necroptosis. Hitomi et al. [10] have recently reported that the induction of necroptosis by zVAD.fmk in L929 cells is associated with increased synthesis of TNFalpha, which potentiates cell death. Therefore, we examined whether Akt and its effectors contribute to TNFalpha synthesis. Consistent with a RIP1-dependent increase in TNFalpha protein (Fig. S6A, B), we found that TNFalpha mRNA levels increased during necroptosis in L929 cells in a RIP1 (Fig. S6C. Under serum free conditions, bFGF alone triggered some induction of TNFalpha mRNA, while its combination with zVAD.fmk (but not zVAD.fmk alone) caused a pronounced further increase (Fig. 6A). Conversely, PDGF caused a modest upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA, which was not further increased in the presence of zVAD.fmk (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that activation of necroptosis is specifically accompanied by a marked increase in autocrine TNFalpha synthesis.\nFurther analysis suggested that both Akt and mTORC1 contribute to the upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA during necroptosis as both small-molecule inhibition and siRNA knockdown of Akt and mTOR reduced TNFalpha mRNA levels in necroptotic cells (Fig. 6B,C,D). Notably, RIP1 and Akt inhibitors had no effect on the levels of TNFalpha mRNA in control cells or in the cells stimulated with bFGF alone (Fig. 6A,B, Fig. S6C), suggesting that these kinases specifically mediate necroptosis-dependent increase in TNFalpha synthesis.",

Therefore, the ability of Akt and mTORC1 inhibitors to block the increase in TNFalpha mRNA lead us to examine their role in the activation of JNK during necroptosis. Knockdown of Akt isoforms Akt1 and Akt2 or inhibition of Akt prominently suppressed the necroptosis dependent increase in JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 6E, S6D,E) suggesting that Akt may provide a link between RIP1 and JNK activation. Importantly, inhibition of Akt only inhibited the delayed, but not the early, increase in bFGF/zVAD.fmk induced JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. S6F).

In the membrane, Akt is phosphorylated on Thr308 and Ser473 by 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and mTORC2 (or DNA-PK), respectively [35]. Since our results showed that only Thr308 Akt phosphorylation is increased during necroptosis, we next examined whether it is still dependent on PI3K and PDK1. Inhibition of PI3K and PDK1 using the specific inhibitors LY249002 and BX912 [36] resulted in the efficient inhibition of cell death and Akt Thr308 phosphorylation (Fig. S7A-D).

        "inputsentence": "Expression of Constitutively Active Akt, Rescues Necroptosis Under Serum Free Conditions\nWe used L929 cells stably expressing constitutively active wild type Akt1 (Myr-Akt) or the catalytically inactive mutant K179M in order to further understand the contribution of growth factors and RIP1 kinase to Akt activation during necroptosis. Constitutively active Akt1 (Myr-Akt) was generated as previously described [37] by the addition of a myristoylation signal which provides constitutive localization to the plasma membrane and by the deletion of the auto-inhibitory PH domain (Fig. 7A) resulting in an Akt that is active under serum free. It is important to note that the cells expressing Myr-Akt were viable, grew in a manner indistinguishable from the empty vector control cells, and were not triggered to induce necroptosis by serum starvation (Fig. 7B). This indicates that active Akt alone is not sufficient to induce necroptotic cell death. Under serum free conditions Myr-Akt, but not the K179M mutant, fully restored zVAD.fmk-induced necroptosis (Fig. 7A,B). Nec-1 prevented both Myr-Akt dependent cell death and the necroptosis-specific delayed increase in Akt Thr308 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B,C). Myr-Akt also allowed other zVAD.fmk-dependent events, including activation of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 7C) and upregulation of TNFalpha mRNA (Fig. 7D) to occur under serum free conditions, confirming an important role for Akt at the apex of necroptotic signaling. These data demonstrated that the presence of active and membrane localized Akt is sufficient to uncouple Akt activation during necroptosis from growth factor signaling. RIP1 kinase was still able to regulate Akt activation during necroptosis, suggesting that growth factors and RIP1 kinase provide two independent inputs required for Akt changes during necroptosis.\nRIP1 kinase-dependent Thr308 phosphorylation of Myr-Akt during necroptosis increased Myr-Akt activity as it did with endogenous Akt (Fig. 5). Phosphorylation of many previously described Akt substrates was increased upon the expression of Myr-Akt, but not the K179M mutant, confirming that these molecules are Akt substrates in L929 cells (Fig. 7C). The effect of zVAD.fmk on their phosphorylation varied, likely due to the increased basal activity of Myr-Akt. Some substrates, including p70S6K, S6, GSK-3 and FoxO4, were fully phosphorylated even in the absence of zVAD.fmk. On the other hand, phosphorylation of FoxO1 and MDM2 was significantly increased in the presence of zVAD.fmk, indicating that necroptotic Thr308 phosphorylation of Myr-Akt still promoted its activity.\nUnder serum free conditions all zVAD.fmk-induced downstream events (cell death, JNK activation, TNFalpha production) were dependent on the over expressed Myr-Akt. This allowed us to examine the effects of other Akt mutations on necroptosis. First, we found that membrane localization of Akt is required. Full length Akt or a mutant lacking both the PH domain and the Myr tag did not support the activation of cell death or increased Thr308 phosphorylation following zVAD.fmk addition under serum free conditions (Fig. S8A,B). Second, we found a specific and critical role for Thr308 phosphorylation in the regulation of the necroptotic functions of Akt. It has been reported that Ala mutations at Thr308 and Ser473 cause a reduction in the catalytic activity of Akt, while Asp mutants increase activity [38]. We examined the effect of Ala and Asp mutants at both sites during necroptosis. In our hands, both Asp mutants displayed activity comparable to wild type Akt, while both Ala mutants displayed comparable decreases in activity (Fig. S8C). Despite similar catalytic activities, Thr308 and Ser473 mutants displayed major differences in their ability to promote necroptotic changes (Fig. 7E,F,G). As expected, the S473D mutant, which was phosphorylated on Thr308 after the addition of zVAD, displayed only slightly reduced activity, while S473A was significantly less active in all aspects of necroptosis. S473A was unable to be efficiently phosphorylated on Thr308 possibly due to the inability of the Ala mutated 473 site to be phosphorylated and provide a docking site for PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr308 [39]. Strikingly, both Ala and Asp mutants of Thr308 were significantly less active in promoting cell death, phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun, and TNFalpha mRNA. This suggests that T308D, in spite of being an active Akt construct, may not be a perfect mimic of phosphorylation and this mutant form of the kinase may not have sufficient activity to phosphorylate the entire repertoire of substrates in the cells. When tested, T308D did not support the downstream phosphorylation of several substrates that were phosphorylated by the Myr-Akt construct in the presence of zVAD including FoxO1, Foxo4, MDM2, and p70S6K (Fig. S8D). Our model, based on these results, is that necroptosis-specific Thr308 phosphorylation provides a critical link between necroptotic machinery and Akt kinase, allowing Akt to phosphorylate substrates during necroptosis, promote TNFalpha synthesis, JNK activation and eventual cell death.",

Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)-deficient Jurkat T lymphocytes and the macrophage cell lines (J774A.1 and RAW264.7) are other models of necroptosis, which can be induced by stimulation with TNFalpha or zVAD.fmk, respectively [17]. Similar to L929 cells, a RIP1 kinase dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Thr308 on Akt occurred during necroptosis (Fig. 8B,D,F) in these cell types. Furthermore, TNFalpha mRNA levels were increased in each of these cell types during necroptosis and efficiently inhibited by both RIP1 and Akt inhibitors (Fig. 8A,C,E). However, inhibition of Akt did not protect these cells from death (Fig. S9A,B,C). These results indicate that regulation of autocrine TNFalpha synthesis and necroptosis-associated inflammatory signaling may be a more important function of Akt pathway activation by RIP1 kinase in multiple cell types compared to its contribution to cell death.\nWe next chose to look at the role of Akt in necroptosis in mouse lung fibroblasts. Lung fibroblasts selected to survive after deletion of all three Akt isoforms [40] were resistant to cell death induced by the addition of TNFalpha and zVAD.fmk. Expression of catalytically active Akt (Myr-Akt) in these cells restored TNFalpha mRNA production in response to TNFalpha and zVAD.fmk (Fig. 8G) without re-establishing cell death (Fig. S9D). Consistent with our earlier Akt knockdown data, lung fibroblasts expressing endogenous Akt1 or Akt2 were phosphorylated on Thr308 in response to TNFalpha and zVAD.fmk (Fig. S9E) and in both cases robust RIP1-dependent TNFalpha mRNA upregulation occurred under necroptotic conditions (Fig. 8H). These data further support the notion that Akt activity is critical for autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, even in the absence of necroptotic cell death, indicating an unexpected differentiation between Akt-mediated inflammatory signaling under necroptotic conditions and cell death per se.",

Altogether, our results suggest that Akt kinase is specifically engaged in signaling downstream from RIP1 kinase, which leads to a selective increase in its phosphorylation on Thr308, but not Ser473. According to our model (Fig. 9), necroptosis-associated phosphorylation of Akt requires two distinct signals. The first input, which is induced by growth factors, leads to the plasma membrane localization of Akt. Expression of a constitutively membrane-targeted Akt construct, Myr-Akt, overcomes the requirement for growth factors. At the same time, expression of Myr-Akt alone is not sufficient for the induction of necroptosis. A second, RIP1 kinase-dependent input is required for Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt in response to caspase inhibition and is essential for the propagation of the necroptotic signal.\nUsing Akt inhibitors, knockdown of Akt isoforms, and the expression of Akt mutants, we showed that necroptotic activation of Akt is indispensable for this form of cell death in L929 cells. We also investigated downstream Akt-dependent pathways that contribute to necroptosis. First, we demonstrated that selective necroptotic phosphorylation of Thr308 of Akt is sufficient to increase its activity towards a number of known substrates and Akt effector pathways such as the mTORC1 pathway, which, in turn, contributes to cell death. Second, our data suggested that Akt activation provides a pivotal link connecting RIP1 kinase to known downstream signaling and execution events in necroptotic L929 cells, namely, JNK activation and autocrine TNFalpha synthesis, a critical event in necroptosis in L929 cells [15].\nIn order to further test our model, we examined Akt phosphorylation after inhibition of a downstream kinase in the pathway, JNK. However, we found that SP600125, which protected L929 cells from death and inhibited TNFalpha production (Fig. 2A,B S2A S10A), inhibited both basal and post-treatment phosphorylation levels of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 (Fig. S10B). It has been published that SP600125 is a somewhat non-specific inhibitor that may inhibit the p110delta subunit of PI3K [41] and PDK1 [42]. Both of these off-target effects could inhibit basal Akt phosphorylation levels, precluding the use of SP600125 in this system.\nTherefore, to examine the role of JNK, we switched to a more specific JNK inhibitor, JNK inhibitor VIII [43], and siRNAs against JNK1 and JNK2 (Fig. S10B-G). As expected, specific inhibition or knockdown of JNK1/2 allowed phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 while inhibiting the phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63 (Fig. S10B,E), agreeing with our model. It did not, however, lead to a reduction in TNFalpha production or cell death (Fig. S10C,D,F,G), suggesting that earlier data with SP600125 protection (Fig. 2) could reflect off-target effects of this molecule, rather than JNK inhibition. Previous reports also suggested a critical role for c-Jun in necroptosis and autocrine TNFalpha synthesis [13], [14], [15] and we confirmed these conclusions using c-Jun siRNA knockdown (Fig. S10H-J). Notably, in this case, Thr308 phosphorylation was reduced after the induction of necroptosis. Thus, autocrine TNFalpha production, dependent on c-Jun, may create a feedback loop that contributes to the delayed activation of Akt. It is also important to note that we observed an overall increase in the protein level of c-Jun after treatment of L929 cells with zVAD.fmk or TNFalpha, which was both Akt and mTOR-dependent (Fig. 6E,F). These new data led us to an unexpected, but important conclusion that c-Jun is critical for necroptosis, while JNK activity may serve as a useful marker of pathway activation, but may be either redundant (e.g. phosphorylation of c-Jun on a site other than Ser63 may occur [44]) or dispensable functionally. In addition, researchers need to use caution when using SP600125 due to potantial off-target effects.",

        "inputsentence": "Altogether, our results suggest that Akt kinase is specifically engaged in the signaling downstream from RIP1 kinase, which exerts its activity through promoting a selective increase in Akt phosphorylation on Thr308. This provides a link connecting RIP1 kinase to downstream signaling and execution events during necroptosis in L929 cells, including JNK activation, autocrine TNFalpha synthesis and eventual cell death. According to our model, phosphorylation of Akt requires two distinct signals. The first input, which is induced by growth factors, leads to the plasma membrane localization of Akt. Expression of constitutively active membrane-targeted Myr-Akt overcomes this requirement. At the same time, expression of Myr-Akt is not sufficient for the induction of necroptosis or efficient activation of JNK and TNFalpha synthesis. A second, RIP1 kinase-dependent input is required for Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt, which in turn is required for necroptotic signaling. Necroptotic phosphorylation of Thr308 of Akt is sufficient to increase its activity towards a number of known substrates in L929 cells and our data reveal that the Akt effector pathway downstream of mTORC1 contributes to necroptosis, thereby identifying a new mediator of this form of cell death.\nOur results raise some important mechanistic questions relevant to the specific regulation of Akt during necroptosis. First, what is the mechanism of the RIP1-dependent increase in Akt Thr308 phosphorylation? One possibility is that RIP1 kinase inhibits a phosphatase that targets Thr308. To our knowledge, PP2A is the only enzyme established to specifically dephosphorylate this residue [45]. However, we did not observe any effect of the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, on Thr308 phosphorylation or activation of necroptosis in L929 cells. Another possibility is that the increase in Thr308 results from RIP1 kinase targeting PDK1, Akt or scaffolding factors that bring these two kinases together. Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation of Akt by recombinant RIP1 kinase in vitro on Thr146, 195/197, and 435 and Ser381 residues. Furthermore, mutating these residues to Ala in Myr-Akt leads to the loss of its ability to promote necroptosis. However, we were not able to confirm phosphorylation of these residues on endogenous Akt in L929 cells using either mass spectrometry or western blotting with a phospho-specific antibody raised against Thr435 peptide, suggesting that direct phosphorylation of Akt by RIP1 likely represents an in vitro artifact and does not reflect endogenous regulation. Second, what are the key substrates of Akt that promote necrotic death and TNFalpha synthesis? On the one hand, our data suggest new roles for Akt effector pathways mediated by mTORC1 in necroptotic control. On the other hand, we have observed only modest changes in mTORC1 activity under necroptotic conditions, suggesting that additional Akt substrates are likely to be involved. This warrants a re-evaluation of the roles of additional Akt substrates in necroptotic death, since no such connections have been established. Similarly, the mechanisms connecting mTORC1 to JNK remain to be elucidated. While there are some recent examples of mTORC1-dependent regulation of JNK, e.g. following ER stress [46], the exact mechanisms during necroptosis remain to be established. Given the activation of JNK by TNFalpha and the importance of mTORC1-dependent translational control in necroptosis, one possibility is that mTORC1 contributes to the translation of TNFalpha and forms a positive feed forward loop with JNK.\nAkt's role as a key inhibitor of apoptosis is well documented, however, evidence of its contribution as a mediator of cell death under various circumstances has begun to emerge as well [45], [47]. Our data demonstrates a new mode of necrosis-specific regulation of Akt by RIP1 kinase. Importantly, while it is possible that necroptosis-specific targets of Akt exist, this regulation clearly involves a number of well established Akt targets including mTORC1, and potentially, GSK-3, FoxO1/4, and MDM2. Therefore, it may no longer be safe to assume that activation of Akt universally reflects pro-survival signaling nor that its inhibition will lead to more cell death. It is tempting to speculate that rather than serving a universally pro-survival role, the Akt pathway may function to promote cell fates alternative to apoptosis, ranging from survival to non-apoptotic cell death. The final decision between survival and death may depend on additional, Akt-independent inputs, such as the status of RIP1 kinase, expression of particular oncogenic factors [45] or excessive metabolic stress [47].\nAnother mechanism that should be considered in conjunction with the regulation of cell death by Akt is autophagy. Akt activation leads to the inhibition of autophagy through activation of mTOR [48]. The role of autophagy in cell death in general is very complex and it can both promote and inhibit necroptosis in various situations. Several studies suggested that activation of autophagy promotes necroptosis induced by zVAD.fmk in L929 cells [11], [14]. Others, including ourselves in unpublished data, have found that inihibition of autophagy promotes necroptosis by TNFalpha [49]. This suggests that the inhibition of autophagy by Akt or mTOR in our system may contribute to necroptosis induced by TNFalpha, however, it is more difficult to reconcile with the positive role of these proteins in zVAD-induced death. Clearly, further identification of the factors differentiating between pro-death and pro-survival autophagy in mammalian cells is required to better understand its role in the regulation necroptosis by Akt pathway.\nImportantly, our data revealed that RIP1 kinase signaling to Akt is a general feature of necroptotic signaling that is observed in multiple cell types. At the same time, the significance of this connection varies in a cell type specific fashion. Importantly, in mouse lung fibroblasts, FADD-deficient Jurkat cells, and macrophages, Akt signaling contributed more prominently to an increase in TNFalpha synthesis, rather than cell death per se, unlike its role in L929 cells. A recent study [15] has demonstrated that, in addition to its role in necroptosis, RIP1 plays an important role in mediating the production of TNFalpha. These data emphasize the emerging complexity of necroptotic signaling mechanisms and highlight the major contribution of Akt to increased inflammatory signaling, specifically accompanying this form of regulated necrosis [5], [6], [10].\nRobust inflammation is one of the most important consequences of necrotic cell death as well as its regulated subtype, necroptosis, both in vitro and in vivo [1], [5], [6], [50], [51]. Our results highlight an important notion that inflammation not only passively accompanies necroptosis in a variety of cellular systems by the virtue of rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity characteristic for necrotic cell death, but also that it is an intrinsic and regulated component of necroptosis due to the specific activation of TNFalpha synthesis by RIP1/Akt kinases. Therefore, this pathway may represent a new molecular target for the inhibition of pathologic inflammatory signaling. Initial in vivo data appears to support this notion. Two recent papers showed that the loss of control over RIP1/RIP3 kinase activities by FADD and caspase-8 in epithelial cells unleashes a feed forward cycle of necroptosis and TNFalpha production, resulting in the development of intestinal inflammation in mice and, possibly, in patients with Crohn's disease [4], [5]. This increased production of TNFalpha during necroptosis may also be important for acute necrotizing diseases, such as necrotizing pancreatitis and acute bacterial infections, where hyper-acute inflammation accompanying necrotic cell death is the primary cause of multiple organ failure and patient death. Along these lines, another recent paper by Duprez et al. has shown that RIP1 and RIP3 mediate the cellular damage introduced by TNF-induced SIRS [6]. The role of RIP1 kinase in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases warrants further investigation, as efficient and specific RIP1 kinase inhibitors may offer therapeutic benefit for treating these conditions.",

Loss of WWOX gene expression is frequently seen in malignant cancer cells due to promoter hypermethylation, genetic alterations, and translational blockade. Intriguingly, ectopic expression of wild type WWOX preferentially induces apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells harboring mutant p53. WWOX is known to physically bind and stabilize wild type p53.

        "inputsentence": "Glioblastoma multiforme afflicts 12,500 new patients in the U.S. annually (Friedman et al., 2000; Stupp et al., 2009; Silber et al., 2012). Glioblastoma (GBM) is highly lethal, and the average survival expectancy is 14.6 months, and the overall 5-year survival rate for GBM is only 9.8% (Friedman et al., 2000; Stupp et al., 2009). High levels of resistance to current therapeutic modalities and cancer relapse are frequently seen in patients (Haar et al., 2012; Happold et al., 2012). The current standard therapy for GBM mainly includes maximum debulking surgery, radiation, and treatment with the monofunctional alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) (Friedman et al., 2000; Nishikawa, 2010). Multiple mechanisms are involved in the TMZ resistance, which may include cancer stem cells, microRNAs, drug efflux, DNA damage repair, tumor cells under hypoxia, histone deacetylation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, STAT3 kinase, and many others (Haar et al., 2012; Happold et al., 2012; Johannessen and Bjerkvig, 2012; Kitange et al., 2012; Kohsaka et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012b).\nTemozolomide induces generation of DNA lesions, including O6-methylguanine, N3-methyladenine, and N7-methylguanine (Goellner et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012b). The O6-methylguanine lesion is known to trigger autophagy, rather than apoptosis, to cause cell death (Kanzawa et al., 2003). Also, inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 by a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor (-)-gossypol leads to autophagic death in gliomas and enhances the action of TMZ (Voss et al., 2010). However, a recent study demonstrated that TMZ-induced autophagy is pro-survival, and may block the eventual apoptosis in GBM cells (Knizhnik et al., 2013). Also, MAPO2 (C1orf201) gene participates in the O6-methylguanine lesion-induced apoptosis (Fujikane et al., 2012). MAPO2 gene encodes a novel 37-kDa protein. It is not determined whether this gene is involved in autophagy.\nThe O6-methylguanine lesion is a substrate for direct repair by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) (Pollack et al., 2006; Hegi et al., 2008; Fukushima et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012b). Without MGMT repair, O6-methylguanine initiates activation of mismatch repair-deficient (MMR) proteins or Rad3-related protein kinase that ultimately leads to apoptotic cell death (Caporali et al., 2004; Wang and Edelmann, 2006; Roos et al., 2007). High expression of MGMT or loss of MMR contributes significantly to TMZ resistance in many clinical cases (Pollack et al., 2006; Hegi et al., 2008; Sarkaria et al., 2008). The initiation of apoptotic signaling fails in the absence of the MMR system.\nSensitivity to TMZ is significantly associated with the methylation status of MGMT gene promoter in cells committed to differentiation (Villalva et al., 2012). An increase in MGMT gene promoter methylation, which blocks MGMT protein expression, prolongs cancer patient survival. Intriguingly, overexpressed microRNA-21 reduces Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, thereby blocking TMZ-induced apoptosis (Shi et al., 2010). MicroRNA-21 is considered as a pro-survival factor for cancer cells (Li et al., 2012). Integrins play a role in the resistance of advanced cancers to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. alpha5beta1 integrin negatively regulates p53 signaling, and the event induces glioma cell resistance to TMZ (Janouskova et al., 2012). alpha5beta1 integrin is considered as a therapeutic target for high-grade brain tumors. The base excision repair enzyme alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylase (APNG), which repairs the cytotoxic lesions N3-methyladenine and N7-methylguanine, also participates in the TMZ resistance (Agnihotri et al., 2012). Upregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain coupling to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulated by cytochrome c oxidase contributes in part to TMZ resistance in gliomas (Oliva et al., 2011).\nReversal of TMZ resistance may be achieved by MGMT pseudosubstrates, O6-benzylguanine and lomeguatrib to sensitize tumors to TMZ (Zhang et al., 2012b). Methoxyamine-blocker of base excision repair contributes significantly to TMZ cytotoxicity particularly when O6-methylguanine adducts are repaired or tolerated (Goellner et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012b). Dual targeting of base excision repair and NAD(+) biosynthesis may reverse TMZ resistance in patients with resistant and recurrent GBM (Goellner et al., 2011). Interferon-beta (IFN-beta), levetiracetam (LEV), resveratrol, and valproic acid (VAP) increase the sensitivity of TMZ through MGMT-dependent or -independent mechanisms (Nakada et al., 2012). Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, reverses TMZ resistance via an NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism (Huang et al., 2012). STAT3 inhibitor or STAT3 knockdown potentiates TMZ efficacy in resistant GBM cell lines (Kohsaka et al., 2012). Intratumoral hypoxia is common in GBMs and may be associated with the development of TMZ resistance. Induced hyperoxia can be utilized to reverse TMZ resistance in GBMs (Sun et al., 2012). Cancer stem cells are probably the key to failure in TMZ treatment. The concept of cancer stem cell survival from treatment with TMZ and other chemotherapeutic drugs has been more complicated than previously thought (Beier et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012). CD133-positive cancer stem cells are expressed in both normal stem cells and cancer stem cells (Donovan and Pilkington, 2012). However, the role of CD133 as a marker for glioma cancer stem cells relative to its biological function has yet to be established.",

        "inputsentence": "Recently, tumor suppressors p53 and WWOX were shown to regulate the apoptosis of glioblastoma cells (Chiang et al., 2012). WW domain-containing oxidoreductase, known as WWOX, FOR, or WOX1, is encoded by human or mouse WWOX/Wwox gene. This gene is located in chromosome 16q23.3-24.1, an area known as the common fragile site FRA16D. The full-length WWOX protein is composed of two N-terminal WW domains, a C-terminal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domain, and a proapoptotic C-terminal tail D3 (Chang et al., 2001, 2007, 2010; Aqeilan et al., 2004, 2007; Hong et al., 2007; Salah et al., 2012) (Figure 1). WWOX may act as an alternative receptor for sex steroid hormones, since its SDR domain possesses an NSYK motif capable of interacting with androgen and estrogen (Chang et al., 2005a; Su et al., 2012).\nExpression of WWOX is either altered or lost from epigenetic modification in multiple malignant cancers, such as non-small cell lung carcinoma (Donati et al., 2007), hematopoietic malignancies (Ishii and Furukawa, 2004), gastric carcinoma (Aqeilan et al., 2004), pancreatic carcinoma (Kuroki et al., 2004), breast carcinoma (Guler et al., 2004; Aqeilan et al., 2007), and glioblastoma multiforme (Kosla et al., 2011). Restoration of WWOX gene prevents the growth of lung cancer (Fabbri et al., 2005), pancreatic cancer (Nakayama et al., 2008), and prostate cancer (Hong et al., 2009).\nThe first WW domain of WWOX may interact with proteins possessing a PPxY motif(s) such as AP-2gamma, p73, ErbB4, Ezrin, SIMPLE, c-Jun, RUNX4, and many others (Chang et al., 2007; Salah et al., 2012; Su et al., 2012; Figure 1). Transiently overexpressed WWOX binds transcription factors AP-2, p73, and c-Jun and block their nuclear relocation in vitro, which suppresses cancer cell survival (Salah et al., 2012). In stark contrast, Wwox co-migrates with proapoptotic and pro-survival transcription factors to the nuclei of neurons upon sciatic nerve axotomy in rats (Li et al., 2009). No blocking of translocation of transcription factors to the nuclei by Wwox was observed.\nUnder stress conditions, WWOX is activated via phosphorylation at Tyr33, and binds proteins independently of the PPxY motif (Chang et al., 2001, 2003, 2005a,b, 2007, 2010). Activated WWOX physically interacts with serine 46-phosphorylated p53 (Figure 1), which stabilizes p53 and its apoptotic function (Chang et al., 2005b). Also, WWOX binds Disheveled proteins (Dvl), which are key components in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (Figure 1). No PPxY motif is in Dvl. Transiently overexpressed WWOX sequesters Dvl-2 in the cytoplasm and thereby blocks Dvl-2-mediated TCF transcriptional activity (Bouteille et al., 2009).\nOverexpressed WWOX induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of human hepatic carcinoma cells (Hu et al., 2012) and many cancer cell types (Chang et al., 2007, 2010; Salah et al., 2012; Su et al., 2012). WWOX enhances the cytotoxic function of tumor necrosis factor by down-regulating apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and up-regulating apoptotic p53 (Chang et al., 2001). Also, WWOX mediates cell death synergistically with p53. Upon exposure to chemicals or environmental stress, such as UV irradiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, WWOX undergoes phosphorylation in Tyr33 and probably others sites, followed by relocating to mitochondria or nuclei for inducing apoptosis (Chang et al., 2007, 2010).\nWWOX binds MEK in Jurkat T cells (Lin et al., 2011). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) dissociates the MEK/WWOX complex and induces WWOX to translocate to the mitochondria to induce apoptosis, whereas MEK relocates to the lipid raft. Inhibition of MEK activity increases TMZ-induced suppression of cancer cell growth (Holt et al., 2012). Ectopic expression of WWOX in A549 cells induces procaspase-3 and procaspase-9 activation and induces cytochrome C releasing from the mitochondria (Zhang et al., 2012a). Complement C1q induces ectopic WWOX phosphorylation in Try33 and leads to cell apoptosis independently of the classical complement activation pathway (Hong et al., 2009). A portion of WWOX is anchored in the membrane/cytoskeleton area via binding with hyaluronidase Hyal-2 (Hsu et al., 2009) and Phospho-Ezrin (Jin et al., 2006). Transforming growth factor beta1 binds Hyal-2 as a cognate receptor to signal the formation of the WWOX/Hyal-2/Smad4 complex to relocate to the nucleus for enhancing the SMAD-driven promoter activity (Hsu et al., 2009).",

Full-length p53, delta133p53, and p53beta are localized mainly in the nucleus, and only few of them are in cytoplasm. p53gamma and delta133p53beta are localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. delta133p53gamma is localized in the cytoplasm (Bourdon et al., 2005). Co-transfection of p53 and p53beta increases p53-mediated apoptosis, whereas co-expression of p53 with delta133p53 suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis (Bourdon et al., 2005). delta133p53 differentially regulates gene expression in p53-dependent and -independent manners (Aoubala et al., 2011).

Loss of functional p53 confers sensitivity to TMZ in glioma cells, whereas wild type p53 increases the TMZ resistance (Blough et al., 2011). p53 mutants reduce TMZ sensitivity in gliomas (Blough et al., 2011).\nAltered WWOX expression is shown in GBMs, in which downregulation of WWOX is associated with loss of heterozygosity and promoter methylation (Kosla et al., 2011). Recently, we demonstrated that overexpressed WWOX induces apoptosis of glioblastoma U373-MG cells harboring mutant p53 by causing hypoploidy and DNA fragmentation (Chiang et al., 2012). However, ectopic WWOX has no effect with U87-MG expressing wild type p53. Unlike TMZ, WWOX induces apoptosis of U373-MG cells via a mitochondria-independent and caspase-3-independent pathway (Chiang et al., 2012). While the underlying mechanisms are unknown, it is reasonable to assume that the survival of human glioblastoma cells depends upon interactions between the gain-of-function of p53 mutants and WWOX. Activated WWOX binds wild type p53 with Ser46 phosphorylation (Chang et al., 2005b). UV irradiation enhances the binding interactions. Despite the presence of Ser46 in delta40p53, binding of this protein with WWOX remains to be determined. We postulate that in GBM cells, both wild type p53 and ectopic WWOX proteins appear to have a functional antagonism, thereby nullifying each other's function in inducing apoptosis (Figure 2). Mutant p53 proteins cannot bind ectopic WWOX in GBM cells, and WWOX is able to induce apoptosis. Whether WWOX causes apoptosis in GBM expressing p53 isoforms is unknown and remains to be established.",

        "inputsentence": "Whether WWOX affects TMZ sensitivity has never been determined. Binding proteins for WWOX and/or p53 are likely to affect apoptosis and TMZ sensitivity in GBM cells. WWOX binds MEK, and that PMA dissociates this complex for causing apoptosis of T leukemia cells (Lin et al., 2011). Thus, appropriate chemicals, which break apart the WWOX/MEK complex, are expected to cause GBM cell death. Preliminary studies from our screening of chemicals have selected certain small molecules that induce apoptosis of many types of cancer cells (Lu et al., unpublished). Indeed, specific inhibition of MEK by selumetinib enhances TMZ-induced cancer cell death in vivo (Holt et al., 2012). Serum factors can be utilized for blocking cancer growth. For example, serum complement C1q induces apoptosis of prostate cancer and neuroblastomas cells without participation of downstream proteins in the classical activation pathway (Hong et al., 2009). In this event, ectopic WWOX is activated for inducing apoptosis.\nFailure of ectopic WWOX in inducing apoptosis of glioma cells possessing wild type p53 is unusual (Chiang et al., 2012). In most cases, we have shown that p53 functionally interacts with WWOX, and both proteins induce apoptosis in a synergistic manner (Chang et al., 2001, 2003, 2005a,b, 2007, 2010, 2012; Su et al., 2012). A likely scenario is that p53-binding proteins, which are present in GBMs, may interfere with the apoptotic function of WWOX and p53. Functional antagonism among tumor suppressors has never been documented in the literature. However, it is not surprising to find that many tumor suppressor proteins, e.g., p53, WWOX, Smad4, PTEN, PP2A, and etc., are significantly upregulated during the early stage of cancer progression (Lai et al., 2005; Chang et al., unpublished). Do these proteins act synergistically in blocking cancer progression but lose control eventually? Or, do they counteract each other's function, thus allowing cancer growth? Whether endogenous WWOX counteracts with the function of endogenous p53 is unknown and remains to be established.\nOne of the unique characteristics for malignant gliomas is their diffuse infiltration into distant brain tissue. Signal pathways, involving PI3K, Akt, mTOR, NF-kappaB, and autophagy, are believed to confer these migrating cells resistant to apoptotic death (Lefranc et al., 2005). Glioma cells possess CD44 as a receptor for interacting with brain matrix hyaluronan (Murai et al., 2004; Yoshida et al., 2012), and secrete hyaluronidases and metalloproteinases to facilitate their migration (Delpech et al., 2002; Junker et al., 2003; Hagemann et al., 2012). Also, lack of WWOX expression is expected to enhance cell migration. For example, loss of WWOX facilitates migration of ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma cells (Gourley et al., 2009; Del Mare et al., 2011). Ectopic expression of TIAF1 (TGF-beta-induced antiapoptotic factor), p53, and WWOX suppresses anchorage-independent growth and cell migration and causes apoptosis in cancer cells (Chang et al., 2012). We believe that glioma cells, with stem cell-like properties, migrate individually rather than collectively. This assumption is based upon our observations that mouse Wwox gene knockout cells (e.g., embryonic fibroblasts) migrate individually and aggressively. In contrast, wild type cells migrate collectively (Chou et al., unpublished). While a portion of WWOX is anchored on the cell membrane/cytoskeleton, WWOX-negative cells lose recognition by parental WWOX-positive cells, and this increases the mobility of WWOX-negative cells to move away from the WWOX-positive cells. Conceivably, WWOX-negative glioma cells migrate individually and turn away from WWOX-expressing brain cells to low WWOX expression areas. Apparently, the migratory behavior of WWOX-negative glioma cells may account for the diffuse invasion into distant brain tissue (Chou et al., unpublished).\nMetabolic alterations have been shown in Wwox knockout mice, including postnatal lethality, bone metabolism defects, ataxia, steroidogenesis, and generation of osteosarcomas (Del Mare et al., 2011; Salah et al., 2012). In a Drosophila model, Wwox is shown to participate in pathways involving aerobic metabolism and oxidative stress for generation of ROS (O'Keefe et al., 2011). Under UV stress, functional Wwox gene expression induces ROS production in Drosophila. Cancer cells are known to overly utilize glycolysis for growth advantage - the so-called Warburg (Moncada et al., 2012). Conceivably, WWOX is likely to override glucose consumption in cancer cells and exerts generation of ROS to curb the cancer cell growth and invasion.\nIn summary, in this perspective article we have discussed the potential role of tumor suppressors p53 and WWOX in regulating TMZ sensitivity in GBM cells. We have shown the role of WWOX in controlling cell migration and metabolic alterations, and discussed the effects of WWOX deficiency and TMZ resistance in cancer cells.",

        "inputsentence": "Schematic diagrams of WWOX structure and its role in signaling. WWOX contains two N-terminal WW domains, a C-terminal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domain, and a D3 region. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) is in between the WW domains (Chang et al., 2003, 2007; Del Mare et al., 2011; Salah et al., 2012; Su et al., 2012; reviews). The SDR domain possesses a mitochondria-binding region. There are two conserved tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr33 and Tyr287. Other phosphorylation sites predicted by NetPhos 2.0 Server are Tyr6, Thr12, Ser14, Tyr61, Tyr293, and Thr3B3, respectively. Upon stress stimulation, WWOX is phosphorylated in Tyr33 and binds p53. The WWOX/p53 complex then translocates to mitochondria or nucleus to induce apoptosis. WWOX also binds PPxY motif-containing transcription factors, such as RUNX2, c-Jun, and ERBB4, via its first WW domain, and the binding blocks the activity of these proteins by retaining them in the cytoplasm. WWOX binds Tau via its SDR domain. WWOX participates in the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway by binding Dvl and inhibiting its nuclear import. Phorbol ester stimulates the dissociation of MEK/WWOX complex in Jurkat T cell, and the released WWOX translocates to the mitochondria for causing cell death. WWOX is recruited to the membrane area by association with Hyal-2 and phospho-Ezrin. Hyal-2 is an alternative receptor for TGF-beta1. In response to TGF-beta1, WWOX binds Hyal-2 and forms a complex, followed by relocating to the nucleus and enhancing the SMAD-driven promoter activity.

(A) Full-length p53 possesses two N-terminal transactivation acidic domains, a proline-rich domain, a central DNA-binding region, and a C-terminal domain, containing a nuclear localization signal, an oligomerization domain, and a basic region. N-terminal deletion mutants of p53 are also shown. (B) Three likely scenarios are proposed for WWOX and p53 to regulate GBM cell death. First, ectopic WWOX fails to induce apoptosis of GBM cells expressing endogenous wild type p53. It appears that ectopic WWOX binds and functionally antagonizes p53, and both proteins nullify each other's function in inducing apoptosis. Second, no physical interactions between mutant p53 proteins and WWOX are expected in GBM cells. Thus, ectopic WWOX induce apoptosis in mutant p53-expressing cells.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent bacterial endotoxin, can induce SerpinB2 expression via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by ~1000-fold over a period of 24 hrs in murine macrophages. To map the LPS-regulated SerpinB2 promoter regions, we transfected reporter constructs driven by the ~5 kb 5'-flanking region of the murine SerpinB2 gene and several deletion mutants into murine macrophages. In addition, we compared the DNA sequence of the murine 5' flanking sequence with the sequence of the human gene for homologous functional regulatory elements and identified several regulatory cis-acting elements in the human SERPINB2 promoter conserved in the mouse. Mutation analyses revealed that a CCAAT enhancer binding (C/EBP) element, a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and two activator protein 1 (AP-1) response elements in the murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter are essential for optimal LPS-inducibility. Electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that LPS induces the formation of C/EBP-beta containing complexes with the SerpinB2 promoter. Importantly, both constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 expression was severely abrogated in C/EBP-beta-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and primary C/EBP-beta-deficient peritoneal macrophages.

        "inputsentence": "The inflammatory response is a double-edged sword. Properly orchestrated, it results in the clearing of foreign molecules and invading pathogens from the body. Uncontrolled, it may lead to organ damage, sepsis, and even cancer [1]-[3]. Many of the pathological manifestations of the inflammatory response are mediated by cytokines and other inducible gene products expressed by macrophages upon exposure to the gram-negative bacterial cell wall component LPS. As macrophages are key effectors of pathogen-induced innate immune responses, their survival is critical for initial pathogen neutralization and subsequent development of adaptive immune responses. One of the most LPS-inducible macrophage gene products known is the ovalbumin-like serine protease inhibitor (ov-serpin) SerpinB2, a widely recognized macrophage survival factor [4]; [5]. SerpinB2 was first identified as an inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)[6]-[8], a serine protease involved in the degradation and turnover of the extracellular matrix through the activation of plasminogen [7]; [9]. Such function requires SerpinB2 to be secreted from the cell yet SerpinB2 exists primarily as a nonglycosylated intracellular protein [10]. Over the past decade, intracellular roles for SerpinB2 in cell survival [11]-[17], proliferation and differentiation [18]-[21], signal transduction [15]; [22]; [23] and innate immunity [24]-[28], have been described.\nThe SerpinB2 gene is highly regulated in a cell type specific manner analogous to that of cytokines and oncogenes [29]; [30]. It is one of the most responsive genes known [31], and can be induced over 1000-fold by LPS [31]-[32], and is up-regulated by a range of inflammatory mediators [9]. LPS activates immune responses through multiple signalling pathways. The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is responsible for the recognition of LPS and other microbial products and plays a central role in the initiation of innate immune responses, including cytokine release. The binding of LPS to TLR4 on the surface of macrophages leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules and the activation of protein kinases, generating signals to the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or phosphoinositide 3(PI3)-kinase pathways [33].\nIn studies aimed at identifying LPS-inducible pro-survival factors downstream of p38 MAPK, SerpinB2 was identified as a factor whose expression was upregulated by cooperation of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK/CREB pathways [16]. Our previously published data indicated that SerpinB2 is distinctly regulated from other LPS-inducible genes in terms of kinetics, LPS dose response and sensitivity to IFN-gamma co-stimulation [4]; however, the cis-acting elements in the SerpinB2 promoter responsible for LPS-dependent transcription in macrophages and the specific LPS-responsive transcription factors that bind the SerpinB2 promoter were not defined. Here we show that LPS induction of SerpinB2 is dependent upon cis-acting regulatory sequences in the region between nucleotides -189 and -539 of the murine SerpinB2 promoter, and is critically dependent upon a C/EBP binding site at -203/-195. C/EBP-beta directly bound to this site in vivo and its deficiency abrogated constitutive SerpinB2 expression and SerpinB2 induction by LPS. Importantly, a C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor site was found to negatively regulate LPS-induced SerpinB2 promoter activity. Together, these findings provide new insight into the transcriptional regulation of the SerpinB2 gene.",

The reporter constructs were then transiently transfected into sub-confluent RAW264.7 macrophages and assayed for luciferase activity in the presence and absence of LPS or PMA, for comparison.

As shown in Fig. 2B, the SerpinB2 5' flanking region from -4480 to +92 directs both PMA- and LPS-inducible transcription, approximately 2-fold and 7-fold, respectively. Deletion of the murine SerpinB2 promoter from -1686 to -1341 increased LPS-inducibility to approximately 16-fold, indicating the presence of a silencer element in this region. Further deletion beyond -539 abolished the LPS-response of the promoter, indicating the presence of an essential LPS response element in the region between -539 and -189; however, the response of the murine SerpinB2 promoter to PMA is less affected by this deletion. While deletion of the SerpinB2 promoter from -189 to -87 eliminated the LPS response and marginally reduced the PMA response, the -87 murine SerpinB2 promoter construct was still partially responsive to PMA, indicating that cis-acting elements mediating the response of the murine SerpinB2 promoter to PMA also lie downstream of nucleotide -87.",

We reasoned that the presence of evolutionarily conserved, potential transcription factor binding sites in this region might play a role in the regulation of SerpinB2 gene expression [52]. The presence of several repetitive sequence elements delineated five broadly homologous regions (A-E) between the human and murine promoters (Fig. 2C). The proximal promoter (Region E), which contains the essential LPS response element, exhibited the greatest homology. Further analysis of Region E revealed that several of the cis-acting regulatory elements defined in the human SerpinB2 proximal promoter are conserved in the murine SerpinB2 promoter (Fig. 3). Specifically, a TATA consensus sequence is located 23 to 29bp upstream from the transcription initiation site, similar to the position of the TATA box of the human SERPINB2 gene [53]; [54]. A putative CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site is present at -192/-203, two potential activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding sites are found at nucleotides -88/-94 and -100/-106, and a putative cyclic AMP response element (CRE) is present at -172/-177. Both of the AP-1 sites are identical in sequence to those identified in the human SERPINB2 promoter, and the CRE differs in the identity of a single central nucleotide [37]; [55]. A consensus E box (-538/-533), as well as potential binding sites for PU.1 (-412/-407) and Oct-1 (-296/-288) were also identified within the proximal promoter region (Fig. S2).

RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS for up to 8 hrs, soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against DNA binding proteins, and the enriched DNA amplified by both semi-quantitative and qPCR using SerpinB2 proximal promoter specific primers (illustrated in fig. 4A).

Re-expression of wild-type C/EBP-beta in Cebpb-/- MEFs significantly stimulated SerpinB2 luciferase reporter gene expression in the presence of LPS by ~3 fold (Fig. 8C, left), confirming the importance of C/EBP-beta to LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene transcription. Expression of the C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor mutant, C/EBPbetaT217A, in Cebpb-/- MEFs did not significantly increase SerpinB2 promoter activity above that of wild-type C/EBP-beta (Fig. 8C, right); confirming that phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at T217 is not a major factor in the regulation of SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS.\nC/EBP-beta contains additional phosphorylation sites, C/EBP-betaT188 and C/EBP-betaS64 (Fig. 8B), which may be involved in modulating C/EBP-beta-dependent SerpinB2 gene transcription.

C/EBP-betaS64 is important for LPS-induced transcription of the cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1 [64]. Similarly, SerpinB2 is induced by LPS and regulated in a manner similar to cytokines [29]. Given the similarities in the functional significance of these phospho-specific isoforms of C/EBP-beta and SerpinB2, we investigated whether these phospho-acceptor sites may play a role in SerpinB2 gene expression. C/EBP-betaT188A-transfected MEFs exhibited SerpinB2 promoter activity similar to that of wild-type C/EBP-beta-transfected MEFs, whereas the expression of C/EBP-betaS64A potentiated SerpinB2 promoter activity in response to LPS (Fig. 8C, right).

        "inputsentence": "Macrophages are key mediators of the innate immune response, and consequently provide the first line of defense against pathogens. Pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as the bacterial endotoxin LPS, stimulate macrophages to mount an anti-pathogenic response which involves massive induction of the pro-survival factor SerpinB2. SerpinB2 is transcriptionally induced by cross talk between the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB and p38MAPK signaling modules in response to LPS [16]. Here we report that SerpinB2 gene transcription in response to LPS is conferred by the SerpinB2 proximal promoter and is greatly dependent upon C/EBP-beta. LPS-induced C/EBP-beta was shown to specifically bind the C/EBP response element in the SerpinB2 proximal promoter in vitro and in vivo, and loss of C/EBP-beta abrogates constitutive SerpinB2 gene transcription and the response to LPS.\nThe murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter region between nucleotides -539 and +92 mediated both PMA- and LPS-inducible gene transcription, with induction by PMA being less intense and more transient than that by LPS. Inspection of the murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter sequence shows that a CRE and two AP-1-like elements, demonstrated to mediate PMA-stimulated transcription of the human SERPINB2 gene [37], also are present in the murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter between nucleotides -189 and -87. These sites may therefore also play a role in mediating PMA-inducible transcription of the murine SerpinB2 gene. In contrast to the pattern of incremental increases in PMA-induced transcriptional activity conferred by regions of the murine SerpinB2 promoter containing these sites, most of the LPS-inducible response is dependent upon cis-acting regulatory sequences in the region between nucleotides -189 and -539. LPS responsiveness absolutely required the C/EBP binding site located in the region between nucleotides -189 and -539, with the downstream CRE and AP-1-like elements also being critical. Of note, there are previous reports of combinatorial interactions between C/EBP-beta and CRE binding proteins (CREB) and AP-1 [63], and C/EBP-beta has been reported to physically interact with AP-1, and NF-kappaB to promote gene expression of inflammatory mediators [63]; [66]. Additionally, CREB has been shown to control transcription of the C/EBP-beta gene [67].\nIn this study, C/EBP-beta was found to be a major requirement for both constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene transcription. In a previous microarray expression profiling study, SerpinB2 was identified as gene whose induction in C/EBP-beta-deficient peritoneal macrophages by LPS and IFNgamma was severely impaired compared to wild-type macrophages [68]. Our qPCR results validate this finding, as we found that both constitutive and LPS-inducible SerpinB2 mRNA expression is significantly abrogated in C/EBP-beta-shRNA transduced peritoneal macrophages, emphasizing the link between C/EBP-beta and SerpinB2 gene transcription. While C/EBP proteins can act as either homodimers or heterodimers [63], we identified C/EBP-beta as the only LPS-inducible C/EBP isoform to bind the SerpinB2 C/EBP response element, suggesting a predominant role for C/EBP-beta in LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene expression. C/EBP-beta, like SerpinB2, plays an important role in inflammation, as it is upregulated by LPS and a host of other inflammatory cytokines [59]; [62]. Furthermore, C/EBP-beta-null mice are susceptible to bacterial infection [69]; [70] and SerpinB2 has been demonstrated to protect from bacterial and viral-induced cell death [14]-[16]; [25]. Thus the regulation of SerpinB2 gene expression by C/EBP-beta is consistent with its functional role in inflammation.\nPhosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at several different amino acid residues has been shown to modulate transactivation of its target genes [63]; . C/EBP-beta phosphorylated on T217 has been reported to rescue macrophages from apoptosis induced by Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin (LT) [65], an activity that has also been attributed to SerpinB2 [16]. However, expression of a C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor site mutant, C/EBPbetaT217A, in Cebpb-/- MEFs did not increase SerpinB2 proximal promoter activity over that of wild-type C/EBP-beta, even though recruitment of C/EBP-betaT217 to the SerpinB2 promoter was observed to decrease following LPS stimulation of RAW264.7 cells. These data indicate that the T217 phospho-acceptor site is not important for the regulation of SerpinB2 gene expression. Similarly, expression of the C/EBP-beta phospho-acceptor site mutant, C/EBP-betaT188A, did not affect SerpinB2 promoter activity differently from that of wild-type. In contrast, expression of C/EBP-betaS64A significantly enhanced LPS-induced SerpinB2 promoter activity, indicating that phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta at S64 negatively regulates LPS-induced SerpinB2 promoter activity. Since C/EBP-beta S64 is constitutively phosphorylated in both RAW264.7 cells and MEFs [73], it is likely that dephosphorylation at this site may be a critical event during LPS-induced transcription of SerpinB2 to increase its promoter activity. Roy and colleagues demonstrated that Mixed lineage kinase-3 (MLK3)-driven dephosphorylation of C/EBP-beta S64 was important for IFNgamma-regulated signaling pathways [73]. Our data suggest that MLK3-driven dephosphorylation of S64 may also be involved in LPS-signaling pathways.\nIn recent years it has become apparent that persistent infection is integrally linked to chronic inflammation and cancer, and immune cells such as macrophages can either promote or attenuate cancer progression [2]; [74]-[76]. SerpinB2 expression has been associated with both inflammation and cancer, and is a favorable or unfavorable prognostic indicator depending on cancer type [77]. The presence of SerpinB2 has been shown to modulate cytokine profiles which can affect immune cell polarization [27]; [28]; [77]; [78]. Interestingly C/EBP-beta has also been shown to modulate cytokine secretion from immune cells, thereby modifying their phenotype [27]; [79]-[81]. Our study has demonstrated that C/EBP-beta plays an important role in mediating both constitutive and LPS-induced transcription of the SerpinB2 gene, which may have implications for the inflammatory phenotype of infiltrating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.\nIn summary, our studies show that the C/EBP site (-203/-195) in the murine SerpinB2 proximal promoter is necessary to support both constitutive and LPS-induced SerpinB2 gene expression. Importantly, we were able to uncover a previously unknown role for C/EBP-betaS64 in negatively regulating SerpinB2 promoter activity. Taken together these data provide new insight into the regulation of inflammation-associated SerpinB2 gene expression.",
